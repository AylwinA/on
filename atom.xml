<p>America has a long celebrated righteous rebellion. When unfair laws were enforced on behalf of a distant and unrepresentative Parliament, American threw off the yoke of tyranny. The leaders of that effort continue to be f&ecirc;ted for their bravery and nobility of purpose. With that tradition, shouldn&rsquo;t we expect protests to break out, given folks in D.C. have proven to be distant and unrepresentative? In the same way, why are we surprised when parts of a community celebrate a descent into lawlessness?</p>

<p>The founding fathers were outraged by repressive governance. The revolution resulted in a system of political checks and balances and unique democratization of the legal process. The unexpected end result was a century of blatant corruption. That too has (mostly) worked out, but politicians still remain open to vote buying expedients. They also have a curious relationship to the law. Successful candidates often have a legal education. Some drove their career forward with publicity from high profile trials at the DA&rsquo;s office. All of this makes politicians part of the problem, not part of the solution.</p>

<p>Lawyer driven administrations continue to accumulate of regulations and laws. America already has more lawyers per capita than any other country. They are also better paid, swallowing a greater percentage of GDP. As the burden of regulation spirals out of control, it should be obvious that something fundamental is wrong. As the Roman historian Tacitus said: &ldquo;<strong>The more corrupt the state, the more numerous the laws.</strong>&rdquo;</p>

<p>One area where corruption has become rampant is recreational drugs. Yes, they are bad. So is liquor, yet after banning it proved fruitless, we found a better way of dealing with it. We haven&rsquo;t yet become adult enough to deal with this issue.</p>

<p>The problem is that each party has a cadre of dedicated helpers drawn from small but active communities. In order to ensure their help, favours are given. An attempt, many years ago, to appeal to the puritanically virtuous elements in party supporters resulted in a war on drugs. To give up that fight risks giving up that support. The party that blinks first loses most.</p>

<p>Because of that misguided plan, prison rates in the US have become the world&rsquo;s highest. Today three quarters of one percent of the <em>whole</em> population is incarcerated. When you only include adults, the figure grows to significantly over 1%. A less gifted 1%, one that no one wants to talk about.</p>

<p>When you only include black adults, the statistics become staggering. Nearly one in three black males between 20&ndash;29 are under some form of criminal justice supervision; either imprisoned, jailed, on parole or probation. The United States has less than 5% of the world&rsquo;s population yet it is burdened with a quarter of the world&rsquo;s prison population.</p>

<p>The average American lives a life of ease unimaginable by the revolutionaries. The average citizen no longer must tend small fields for long hours to earn subsistence and little more. Instead, the modern American endures a boring job, believes it doesn&rsquo;t pay enough, and trusts in a natural a right to justice along with untrammelled enjoyment of the world&rsquo;s highest standard of living.</p>

<p>Our forefathers worried about survival. We worry that wages are stagnant while those who run the country promote inflation. Erosion of the ability of the average American to earn, spend, and enjoy is for most of us, a crisis. The unequal distribution of punishment by the law is a story we have heard of, but don&rsquo;t really believe is happening.</p>

<p>The origin of much of this &lsquo;criminality&rsquo; is in mistaken laws. Some laws pay the poor to remain poor. The worst criminalize the only activities some of these social outcasts have skills for. This has created a culture that knows &lsquo;the man&rsquo; is against them and celebrates every petty opportunity to hit back</p>

<p>The makers of those laws have been allowed to arrogantly continue on the same doomed course, doubling up on laws, on policing, adding military gear to use against their own people. They fail to understand that laws have to be reasonable to be effective.</p>

<p>The</p>

<h2>An IP a day Keeps the Debtors Away</h2>

<p>The lawyering up of modern society has transformed our economy into one based on rights holdings. America&rsquo;s great companies no longer make physical products. Instead of railroads and heavy industry, Banks and Google are the most profitable per employee. Google&rsquo;s geeks lucked into virtual control of internet advertising and at least try to follow their motto &ldquo;<em>Don&rsquo;t be evil</em>.&rdquo;
Apple, the stock market&rsquo;s richest company, is in many ways startlingly similar to Google and Goldman Sachs.</p>

<p>Apple has a design portfolio that allows it to do little more than litigate while marketing products designed and made by captive foreign manufacturers. This shift from making things to rent collection been based almost entirely on international laws, like those governing Intellectual Property rights.</p>

<p>The problems in Ferguson have their roots in one simple perception: The law is unequal and dangerous. It clearly treats the wealthy and whites better than others. Even among those who are supposedly favoured by the system, the costs of due process destroy wealth and consume lives. Law has degenerated into a tool of oppression. Misrule of law doesn&rsquo;t just grind down people. Bad laws and indifferent lawyers are ruining an entire country.</p>

<blockquote><p>All around the world, lawyers generate more hostility than the members of any other profession&hellip;. But there are few places where clients have more grounds for complaint than America.
<em>&mdash;The Economist</em></p></blockquote>

<p>One American in 265 works as a lawyer. Doesn&rsquo;t sound so bad, until you realize &frac14; of the population is under twenty (know any kids practising law?) and 1/3 of those working age don&rsquo;t actually work. Heck, when we take out the underemployed and the aged, it becomes even worse. Lets just say that around one percent of the fully employed are lawyers. Now where have we seen that figure before&hellip;.</p>

<p>The lawyering up of modern America has been a significant part of the transformation of our economy into one based on renting out rights. Great companies no longer manufacture great products. Instead of relying on heavy industry, technology rents are producing all the wealth. If that doesn&rsquo;t make sense, think about the Microsoft software you use every day, but can no longer own.</p>

<p>Many American oil companies are also raking in the bucks. Their money comes from high tech as
well. Fracking for shale oil is impossible without 3D seismic, directional drilling, and a whole host of other technologies only geeks can understand. Those companies thrived
under high oil prices and may collapse on low. For now, like Jed Clampett, they produce liquid
gold, &lsquo;renting&rsquo; technology and mineral rights (making their owners rich) while needing hardly any staff.</p>

<p>Apple lucked into patentable control of digital music, and from there stumbled into phones. Its intellectual property portfolio allows it to do little more than litigate away competition while selling at great profit products designed and made by captive foreign manufacturers. This kind of market control easily leads to complacency. Since this has long been one of Apples problems, expect things there to start going downhill. Maybe not this year, but given a few years their role in phones may look a lot like Blackberry.</p>

<p>This shift from making things to rent collection is based almost entirely on laws governing Intellectual Property rights. These laws have been crammed down the throats of every country wishing to trade with the good old USA. It is amusing to look back at the past behaviour of great American companies. The founder of Hershey chocolates proudly proclaimed that he had stolen the secrets of fine chocolates from the Swiss, using this claim to promote his brand. IP exists because it benefits America&rsquo;s leading companies. It isn&rsquo;t clear that it benefits the average person, and especially it doesn&rsquo;t help the developing world</p>

<p>All this modern legal stuff letting high tech companies earn high rewards also leads to one obvious problem. There are mostly lawyers, techies and salespeople on the inside. Some of those salespeople, like the bankers, are so good we&rsquo;re convinced they are experts who&rsquo;s financial advice clients can trust. Right.</p>

<p>The same bright lawyers in America&rsquo;s administration have undone structures established over generations to stabilize prices. With the help of brilliant programmers, hedge funds have exploited those markets, making billions by orchestrating, anticipating and encouraging price swings. These price swings make business riskier, but they also make bankers rich.</p>

<p>This leaves us in a position were ordinary jobs are increasingly insecure because of growing swings in commodity prices. Wealth is accumulating around those who take great risks that increase volatility and get rich from it, yet have a government safety net as they are &ldquo;too big to fail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With no one left producing real goods, those not in the system end up in the service economy. Service jobs, like flipping burgers or washing windows, don&rsquo;t pay well. They also destroy self esteem.</p>

<p>Ferguson ran aground over years of grievances about racial problems with policing. It is the tip of the iceberg of a far larger problem. With the average Joe unable to get into companies that control the high tech economy, many are slowly accepting they are losers. Holding no stakes in anyone else&rsquo;s success, unsure where they will be in a few years, given a chance some will act out their frustration. Don&rsquo;t be surprised when even more people turn up when some event triggers an equal-opportunity excuse to light bonfires in the streets.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fewer and fewer people believe they know how to make friends. We obviously have bigger things to worry about, yet this small failing can easily make life miserable. One modern solution is to plead having some flavor of autism, as if this is an all purpose replacement for social competence. I&rsquo;m tempted to do it myself sometimes, but I can assure you it doesn&rsquo;t work. Ignoring people you don&rsquo;t know how to deal with just makes them more irritated.</p>

<p>In our culture of strangers, where we may never talk to our own neighbours, poor social skills are a common problem. Unless we find effective ways to deal with those mysterious &lsquo;others&rsquo;, we&rsquo;ll never make friends, never form new relationships. We&rsquo;ll just be another lost soul, hurrying through life with eyes downcast, unaware of all the fascinating and irritating life around us. Some skill at interacting with those who do fall into our orbit is essential to enjoying life.</p>

<p>The challenges of enjoying other people&rsquo;s company can be thought of in two parts. First we want a way to render disgruntled people we interact with on a daily basis more amiable. Second, we need to find more effective ways to get to know those who are, for some odd reason, predisposed to enjoy being around us.</p>

<p>So what is it that we need to change? For now, I&rsquo;ll stick to the first challenge, getting twits to be more accommodating. My favourite simple instruction is to &ldquo;think good thoughts&rdquo; about the people we deal with. Some people make that particularly hard to do, but with a little luck our positive influence helps them to start thinking better of us&mdash;even while they continue behaving like jerks. Remember, you aren&rsquo;t going to change their nature, just the degree of animosity you have to endure from them.</p>

<p>The heart of this skill is finding something&mdash;<em>anything</em>&mdash;about them to sympathize with. If it doesn&rsquo;t work, complain to Will Rogers. He&rsquo;s the one who claimed: &ldquo;I never met a man I couldn&rsquo;t like.&rdquo; Arriving at equanimity takes effort. You actually have to take time to find out what interests someone, what they might respond to. Rather than listening to gossip, which often has biases, you might actually try asking them. Surely your foe can&rsquo;t be irritating in <em>every</em> aspect of their lives. (In case that doesn&rsquo;t turn out to be true, I can only suggest you flee their influence as far and fast as humanly possible)</p>

<p>A corollary of that instruction is to avoid giving into the temptation to bad-mouth blockheads. Yes, they deserve it, and it does make you feel better. Well, at least temporarily. The problem is that louts <strong>will</strong> hear about your complaints. Usually presented to them in the worst possible light. Keeping your mouth shut with a little luck will fool evil idiots into suspecting you are a better person than you really are. Isn&rsquo;t it better to leave trolls confused rather than becoming all angry and vicious the moment they see you?</p>

<p>We both know that thinking well of others, even when they act foolishly, is not an easy or quick solution. And we by nature prefer easy short term solutions. I can only suggest trying it out, seeing if it will work for you. Since by nature we also resist change, some effort will be involved. The root of resistance to change is the delusion that our opinions are inviolable, that they define who we are. But Kongzi, who oddly enough we call Confucius, told it straight:</p>

<blockquote><p>They must often change opinions who would be constant in happiness or wisdom.</p></blockquote>

<p>However, some people prefer their instructions to be more direct. Hence Lao Tzu at his most succinct:</p>

<blockquote><p>Only when I let go of what I am can I become what I might be.</p></blockquote>

<p>For those who require more detailed instructions he gave them as well:</p>

<blockquote><p>Treat those who are good with goodness, and also treat those who are not good with goodness. Thus goodness is attained. Be honest to those who are honest, and be also honest to those who are not honest. Thus honesty is attained.</p>

<p>Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have to confess this isn&rsquo;t my first blog. While living in china I tried out a blogging site that I filled with pictures to flesh out bare accounts about my travels. Then microsoft&rsquo;s corporate wizards merged what I had adopted as my platform with another. The formatting was altered so much that the bulk of my images looked pathetic. I was lazy about fixing them, which in hindsight was probably a good thing. Soon after, the great firewall of china reared up and blocked the new site completely. I chose to abandon it.</p>

<p>My next effort was part of my own small business website that was supposed to promote the wide range of my developer skills. As you can guess, that cramped my creativity. A lot. There was no way I could rant about trivia on a site promoting dull but reliable web-design efforts. The site cost more than the work it was bringing in (none) so eventually it too was abandoned.</p>

<p>Last month a friend inadvertantly convinced me to try blogging again, this time with the hope that I will be consistant enough and interesting enough to have these rambles form the basis of an ebook. Well, actually, she figured I should just sit down and write one. Having tried many times what for me always turns into an unpleasant and unfruitful process, I&rsquo;m instead hoping random spells of creativity will magically coalesce into something interesting. At least this way I&rsquo;ll have <em>some</em> pages presentable. Willing to take any bets on my eventual success?</p>

<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t work that way, I&rsquo;m hoping this site will at least end up an aesthetically acceptable blog. To that end, I want full control, yet I&rsquo;m too cheap to be paying to publish. After all, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to count on earning big bucks from offering unconventional (yet only occasionally controversial) opinions to the world. Well, at least not these days. The internet is cluttered with so many millions of words supporting so many strange ideas that I can&rsquo;t rationally expect anyone to find this site.</p>

<p>What you find yourself (almost miraculously) reading is starting its life hosted on github. In the process of getting this site up I ran into innumerable headaches with free accounts using jekyll (the software running this site, paired with octopress, after abondoning pairings with yeoman and grunt). I was driven back to github after failing to reliably deploy to heroku and openshift. For some reason I didn&rsquo;t even get around to testing amazon&rsquo;s host, even though they promise to charge only pennies a month on the low level usage I expect. At least I learned something. Several days of frustration made it clear why so many people willingly pay for the pleasure of seeing their words looking good online.</p>

<p>The cause of most of my problems were instructions that didn&rsquo;t work. While most of the world uses windows computers, almost all the clever dudes setting up free stuff do so in some flavour of unix. Windows, based on unix since NT, only with a great deal of persuation will do full blown unix type things. I have a hard time understanding how apple, a reluctant convert to unix and for years a company that filled their halls with lawyers and marketers while treating programmers as expendable, somehow became the favourite of web programming geeks. Using my windows box to attempt to follow apple based unix instructions proved to be a refined form of mental torture. Sigh.</p>

<p>Since you read this far, you might enjoy a picture from one of the adventures in china that inspired my original blog. Below is a scene from juihuashan, or nine flower mountain, a popular buddhist site. The original temple the pond graces was started shortly after the arrival, almost 1300 years ago, of an intensely devoted korean prince who chose to live in what was then the wilds of china and is even now barely touched by development. He spent 75 years living on the mountain as an impoverished but increasingly spiritually powerful buddhist monk. He is said to be still there, sitting in samadhi inside a massive bell sealed under the foundations of the main building. Throughout china he is known as the incarnation of the god of earth.</p>
