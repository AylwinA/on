  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most people noticed the recent collapse of oil prices. I followed it in excruciating detail, as I invested heavily in oil stocks that started out worth many times what they are today. I held onto them with grim determination throughout their rapid descent, as logic insisted that the price of oil could not fall this far.</p>

<p>I made one of the classic errors of investors. Belief that logic will win out is the enemy of speculation. The market follows emotion, and emotions can be tricked into wanting things injurious to life.</p>

<p>If I am to make that money back, I have to figure out what emotions investors will be feeling over the next few months. Knowing that, I can guess where the market is going and place better bets. I&rsquo;m going to do some thinking here, hoping to stumble into a useful answer.</p>

<p>The first thing to look at is the irrational beliefs that dominate the market. One of the most wide spread is the belief that production of oil has no limits. Unfortunately folks, there is a fixed amount of oil in the ground, and once it is gone, we are done. It would be nice to believe renewables will take oil&rsquo;s place, but wind has never been very good at pushing cars the direction we want.</p>

<p>People have faith that batteries will come to our rescue, forgetting the immense number needed would consume more lithium or lead than is available. Until we think of some brilliant alternative, our way of life depends on oil. Not that our way of life is necessarily a good one, but we haven&rsquo;t planned out realistic alternatives. And oil isn&rsquo;t getting any easier to get our hands on.</p>

<p>Actually, it is worse than that. Oil lurks in &lsquo;traps&rsquo; unless it is heavy oil lying near the surface waiting to leach into the environment. The remaining oil not in the middle east is either out at sea, otherwise hard to get at, or tight oil, the stuff that has to be fracked. This stuff is stuck in stone&mdash;usually shale&mdash;that is barely porous and hard to get it out of. That is why drillers have to shatter the trap under extraordinary pressure, then jam proppants into the cracks to keep them open.</p>

<p>Fracking is weird stuff, using millions of gallons of water along with mystery ingredients that dissolve difficult rocks or prevent stubborn bacteria or chemical deposits gumming things up. Weirdly enough, they also use guar gum as a gelling agent to hold proppant in solution (you many know it as an indigestible food additive.) The most fascinating items are radioactive tracer isotopes used to determine the location of fractures.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the classic Zen koans asks &ldquo;if a tree falls in the forest and no one hears, does it make a sound?&rdquo; One&rsquo;s first reaction is to think this a stupid question. Sound is created by the falling tree, so there is no need for an observer.</p>

<p>To the Zen master, there may be sound, or there may not be sound. This depends on sound&rsquo;s reality being nothing but <em>an interpretation by a mind</em> of shock waves generated in the air by the tree. The question is asked of the student to help separate their mind&rsquo;s automatic and completely unnoticed interpretation of the world from the world&rsquo;s underlying reality.</p>

<p>What we believe to be real is our mind dealing with information from our senses. The first understanding of what is real, once we accept our mind and senses can easily create a false reality, is that what is real ought to be what caused our senses to react. But is that the fundamental reality? Following the logic of the koan, we come to realize we are neither the objects of experience nor what we experience. We are the experiencer. Only this is true. As Descartes put it: &ldquo;Cogito, ergo sum.&rdquo; In ordinary English, &ldquo;I think, therefore I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Descartes was attempting to find a foundation, a reality that could not be denied. He realized that all sense impressions were not a fundamental truth, just an experience. When we dream, afterwards&mdash;and only afterwards&mdash;we know the experience is false. When we are awake, what proof do we have have of this long drawn out experience being reality, and not just some greater illusion that will be followed by a greater afterwards?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>&ldquo;There are many temptations in this life, but cake is probably one of the biggest of them.&rdquo;
 &mdash;Alexander McCall Smith</p></blockquote>

<p>Today I baked four loaves of a traditional heavy, nutty fruitcake, totally free of the chemical excesses of maraschino cherries. In a few days I&rsquo;ll make an even healthier gluten free apricot fruitcake for my sister, who is far too busy to spend hours prepping all the fruit.</p>

<p>My digging out the recipes for Christmas cake is one the first signs of Christmas around here. An even more ominous sign is that a few days ago it snowed, a careful dusting of white over lawns and gardens, one that politely melted off paths and roads. The season is moving forward, days shortening, long, cold nights taking over more and more of life. It will be interesting to see what changes this winter brings.</p>

<p>Winter is a time of sleep for most of nature, a time of transformation, when the seeds of our future rest, waiting for a time when their sprouting will be safe. It seems natural to think of this as the end of the year, but is it fair to call it the start of a new one? Our calendar shows the year ending on December 31st, but this is a date picked almost at random.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Time has no divisions to mark its passage, there is never a thunder-storm or blare of trumpets to announce the beginning of a new month or year. Even when a new century begins it is only we mortals who ring bells and fire off pistols.&rdquo; <br>
&mdash;Thomas Mann</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The minute you read something you can&rsquo;t understand, you can almost guarantee it was drawn up by a lawyer.&rdquo; &mdash;Will Rogers</p></blockquote>

<p>The problems in Ferguson have their roots in one simple perception: the law is dangerous. Worse, it seems to deliberately treat the wealthy and whites better than others. Even among those supposedly favoured by the system, the weight of due process routinely crushes the innocent. Our legal system has, over centuries, degenerated into unmanageable complexity. In the process it became dark and dangerous.</p>

<p>Abuse of justice doesn&rsquo;t just grind down people. Bad laws conspire with greedy and indifferent custodians of the law to ruin faith in the American dream. When we no longer share aspirations, the tacit assent to the rules that holds a democracy together starts to fail.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is an essential justice which cements society, and one source of the laws establishing justice. That source is logical reasoning. This is the truth that validates all commandments and prohibitions. Whoever neglects this source of laws, whether written or unwritten, is necessarily unjust and wicked.&rdquo; &mdash;Cicero</p></blockquote>

<p>Not all Ferguson&rsquo;s problems come from heavy handed policing. Some irritants are due to laws and lawyers that fail Cicero&rsquo;s test of being logical. Enough people have focussed on the faults of cops in causing Ferguson&rsquo;s problems. Isn&rsquo;t it time other parts of the legal system, those that are themselves unjust, get their moment?</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All around the world, lawyers generate more hostility than the members of any other profession&hellip;. But there are few places where clients have more grounds for complaint than America.&rdquo;
 &mdash;The Economist</p></blockquote>
