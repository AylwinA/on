  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>&ldquo;There are many temptations in this life, but cake is probably one of the biggest of them.&rdquo;
 &mdash;Alexander McCall Smith</p></blockquote>

<p>Today I baked four loaves of a traditional heavy, nutty fruitcake, totally free of the chemical excesses of maraschino cherries. In a few days I&rsquo;ll make an even healthier gluten free apricot fruitcake for my sister, who is far too busy to spend hours prepping all the fruit.</p>

<p>My digging out the recipes for Christmas cake is one the first signs of Christmas around here. An even more ominous sign is that a few days ago it snowed, a careful dusting of white over lawns and gardens, one that politely melted off paths and roads. The season is moving forward, days shortening, long, cold nights taking over more and more of life. It will be interesting to see what changes this winter brings.</p>

<p>Winter is a time of sleep for most of nature, a time of transformation, when the seeds of our future rest, waiting for a time when their sprouting will be safe. It seems natural to think of this as the end of the year, but is it fair to call it the start of a new one? Our calendar shows the year ending on December 31st, but this is a date picked almost at random.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Time has no divisions to mark its passage, there is never a thunder-storm or blare of trumpets to announce the beginning of a new month or year. Even when a new century begins it is only we mortals who ring bells and fire off pistols.&rdquo; <br>
&mdash;Thomas Mann</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The minute you read something you can&rsquo;t understand, you can almost guarantee it was drawn up by a lawyer.&rdquo; &mdash;Will Rogers</p></blockquote>

<p>The problems in Ferguson have their roots in one simple perception: the law is dangerous. Worse, it seems to deliberately treat the wealthy and whites better than others. Even among those supposedly favoured by the system, the weight of due process routinely crushes the innocent. Our legal system has, over centuries, degenerated into unmanageable complexity. In the process it became dark and dangerous.</p>

<p>Abuse of justice doesn&rsquo;t just grind down people. Bad laws conspire with greedy and indifferent custodians of the law to ruin faith in the American dream. When we no longer share aspirations, the tacit assent to the rules that holds a democracy together starts to fail.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is an essential justice which cements society, and one source of the laws establishing justice. That source is logical reasoning. This is the truth that validates all commandments and prohibitions. Whoever neglects this source of laws, whether written or unwritten, is necessarily unjust and wicked.&rdquo; &mdash;Cicero</p></blockquote>

<p>Not all Ferguson&rsquo;s problems come from heavy handed policing. Some irritants are due to laws and lawyers that fail Cicero&rsquo;s test of being logical. Enough people have focussed on the faults of cops in causing Ferguson&rsquo;s problems. Isn&rsquo;t it time other parts of the legal system, those that are themselves unjust, get their moment?</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All around the world, lawyers generate more hostility than the members of any other profession&hellip;. But there are few places where clients have more grounds for complaint than America.&rdquo;
 &mdash;The Economist</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fewer and fewer people believe they know how to make friends. We obviously have bigger things to worry about, yet this small failing can easily make life miserable. One modern solution is to plead having some flavor of autism, as if this is an all purpose replacement for social competence. I&rsquo;m tempted to do it myself sometimes, but I can assure you it doesn&rsquo;t work. Ignoring people you don&rsquo;t know how to deal with just makes them more irritated.</p>

<p>In our culture of strangers, where we may never talk to our own neighbours, poor social skills are a common problem. Unless we find effective ways to deal with those mysterious &lsquo;others&rsquo;, we&rsquo;ll never make friends, never form new relationships. We&rsquo;ll just be another lost soul, hurrying through life with eyes downcast, unaware of all the fascinating and irritating life around us. Some skill at interacting with those who do fall into our orbit is essential to enjoying life.</p>

<p>The challenges of enjoying other people&rsquo;s company can be thought of in two parts. First we want a way to render disgruntled people we interact with on a daily basis more amiable. Second, we need to find more effective ways to get to know those who are, for some odd reason, predisposed to enjoy being around us.</p>

<p>So what is it that we need to change? For now, I&rsquo;ll stick to the first challenge, getting twits to be more accommodating. My favourite simple instruction is to &ldquo;think good thoughts&rdquo; about the people we deal with. Some people make that particularly hard to do, but with a little luck our positive influence helps them to start thinking better of us&mdash;even while they continue behaving like jerks. Remember, you aren&rsquo;t going to change their nature, just the degree of animosity you have to endure from them.</p>

<p>The heart of this skill is finding something&mdash;<em>anything</em>&mdash;about them to sympathize with. If it doesn&rsquo;t work, complain to Will Rogers. He&rsquo;s the one who claimed: &ldquo;I never met a man I couldn&rsquo;t like.&rdquo; Arriving at equanimity takes effort. You actually have to take time to find out what interests someone, what they might respond to. Rather than listening to gossip, which often has biases, you might actually try asking them. Surely your foe can&rsquo;t be irritating in <em>every</em> aspect of their lives. (In case that doesn&rsquo;t turn out to be true, I can only suggest you flee their influence as far and fast as humanly possible)</p>

<p>A corollary of that instruction is to avoid giving into the temptation to bad-mouth blockheads. Yes, they deserve it, and it does make you feel better. Well, at least temporarily. The problem is that louts <strong>will</strong> hear about your complaints. Usually presented to them in the worst possible light. Keeping your mouth shut with a little luck will fool evil idiots into suspecting you are a better person than you really are. Isn&rsquo;t it better to leave trolls confused rather than becoming all angry and vicious the moment they see you?</p>

<p>We both know that thinking well of others, even when they act foolishly, is not an easy or quick solution. And we by nature prefer easy short term solutions. I can only suggest trying it out, seeing if it will work for you. Since by nature we also resist change, some effort will be involved. The root of resistance to change is the delusion that our opinions are inviolable, that they define who we are. But Kongzi, who oddly enough we call Confucius, told it straight:</p>

<blockquote><p>They must often change opinions who would be constant in happiness or wisdom.</p></blockquote>

<p>However, some people prefer their instructions to be more direct. Hence Lao Tzu at his most succinct:</p>

<blockquote><p>Only when I let go of what I am can I become what I might be.</p></blockquote>

<p>For those who require more detailed instructions he gave them as well:</p>

<blockquote><p>Treat those who are good with goodness, and also treat those who are not good with goodness. Thus goodness is attained. Be honest to those who are honest, and be also honest to those who are not honest. Thus honesty is attained.</p>

<p>Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have to confess this isn&rsquo;t my first blog. While living in china I tried out a blogging site that I filled with pictures to flesh out bare accounts about my travels. Then microsoft&rsquo;s corporate wizards bought the one I&rsquo;d used, merging it with another. The formatting was altered so much that the bulk of my images looked pathetic. I was lazy about fixing them, which in hindsight was probably a good thing. Soon after, the great firewall of china reared up and blocked the new site completely.</p>

<p>My next effort was part of my own small business website that was supposed to promote the wide range of my developer skills. As you can guess, that cramped my creativity. A lot. There was no way I could rant about trivia on a site promoting dull but reliable web-design efforts. The site cost more than the work it was bringing in (none) so eventually it too was abandoned.</p>

<p>Last month a friend inadvertently convinced me to try blogging again, this time with the hope that I will be consistent enough and interesting enough to have these rambles form the basis of an ebook. Well, actually, she figured I should just sit down and write one. Having tried many times what for me always turns into an unpleasant and unfruitful process, I&rsquo;m instead hoping random spells of creativity will magically coalesce into something interesting. At least this way I&rsquo;ll have <em>some</em> pages presentable. Willing to take any bets on my eventual success?</p>

<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t work that way, I&rsquo;m hoping this site will at least end up an aesthetically acceptable blog. To that end, I want full control, yet I&rsquo;m too cheap to be paying to publish. After all, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to count on earning big bucks from offering unconventional (yet only occasionally controversial) opinions to the world. Well, at least not these days. The internet is cluttered with so many millions of words supporting so many strange ideas that I can&rsquo;t rationally expect anyone to find this site.</p>

<p>What you find yourself (almost miraculously) reading is starting its life hosted on github. In the process of getting this site up I ran into innumerable headaches. Jekyll (the software running this site) ended up paired with octopress, after abandoning pairings with yeoman and grunt. I was driven back to github after failing to reliably deploy to heroku and openshift. For some reason I didn&rsquo;t even get around to testing amazon&rsquo;s host, even though they promise to charge only pennies a month on the low level usage I expect. At least I learned something. Several days of frustration made it clear why so many people willingly pay for the pleasure of seeing their words looking good online.</p>

<p>To edit each post I now use notepad++, then use a command window to create a temporary local site to see how it looks. When everything works, in another command window I run a rake routine that pushes the new version to github. Easy peasy, eh?</p>

<p>The cause of most of my problems were instructions that didn&rsquo;t work. While most of the world uses windows computers, almost all the clever dudes setting up free stuff do so in some flavour of unix. Windows, based on unix since NT, only with a great deal of persuasion will do full blown unix type things. Using my windows box to attempt to follow apple based unix instructions proved to be a refined form of mental torture. Sigh.</p>

<p>I have a hard time understanding how apple, a reluctant convert to unix and for years a company that filled their halls with lawyers and marketers while treating programmers as expendable, somehow became the favourite of web programming geeks. Well, maybe I should confess I suspect why&mdash;Apple simply didn&rsquo;t have the programming chops to make the flavour of unix they bought run software from their old OS, so the unix they use remains easy to port to. Coding is so much easier when you are willing to blow off the entire powerPC user base.</p>

<p>Since you read this far, you might enjoy a picture from one of the adventures in china that inspired my original blog. Below is a scene from jiuhuashan, or nine flower mountain, a popular buddhist site. The original temple the pond graces was started shortly after the arrival, almost 1300 years ago, of an intensely devoted korean prince. He chose to live in the wilds of china, an area so difficult to reach that even now it is barely touched by development. He spent 75 years living on the mountain as an impoverished but increasingly enlightened buddhist monk. He is said to be still there, sitting in samadhi inside a massive bell sealed under the foundations of the main building. Through much of china he is revered as the incarnation of the god of earth.</p>
