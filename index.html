  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last year I created a new site, and it was good. Yet no one read it, so I approached the great Google and requested that it add its magic of analytics to my site. Google graciously did so, and that too was good.</p>

<p>Then I began reading the results on Google&rsquo;s website, and they were not good. Behold, there were many visits, but they were all by me. Displeased, I returned to Google and requested that the data be more pure, so I could know the truth, even if it were bitter.</p>

<p>Google&rsquo;s site wizards suggested that if I screened out visits from my own URL the data would be better. As soon as I set up that filter Google warned me that my data might no longer be valid. I became worried and returned, hoping to verify that Google&rsquo;s first suggestion was correct. After carefully checking everything it became clear that Google believed I was too stupid to understand that I had excluded my own visits from my data.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise when I discovered, after all this fuss, that none of my past visits had been filtered out. Perhaps the purity of raw data is so important to Google that a little thing like my desire to only see others visiting my site is not important. Perhaps it is careful programming, saving a few millionths of a second of processing time by throwing data out on input, but not actually filtering existing data. Surely this irritating result is not how the great Google operates?</p>

<p>From there it became even more interesting. Apparently Google&rsquo;s long tailed search engine (the one that finds answers to peculiarly detailed requests that few care about) managed to find me visitors from the mysterious heartland of Russia. I was very happy, especially as there were several of them, and they returned again and again. After a few days I noticed many never actually stopped to read my pages. I became curious and decided to visit their referring links. There were only a few of them. Imagine my surprise when I found they all led to the same place. Even more interesting, the same URLs on different days led to different places.</p>

<p>I happened to install anti-malware software a few days ago. Imagine my surprise when I went to see where those links lead&mdash;they were now blocked as dangerous sites. Not the kind of message you want to see. The day after I noticed this, my site visits fell to zero. Sadly, I found I preferred phantom visits to a total absence of visits.</p>

<p>How could such strange data exist, you ask? This is part of the mystery of the analytics of Google. On one hand, perhaps American institutions are so afraid of Russian ones that they automatically blacklist them or otherwise distort their results. Or perhaps Google inadvertently found me a place in some sort of Gulagian click-farm. You know, like they have for Facebook, where in order to fool the algorithms that stand guard over the riches paid by advertisers, clever bots &lsquo;like&rsquo; paying and semi-random unpaid pages. This fools weak algorithms and increases the wealth of clever programmers.</p>

<p>Surely no one has so thoroughly fooled the clever analytics of Google&mdash;unless the programmers at Google figure this is just an edge case. But if this is an edge case that works, you can be sure there will be a lot more promotion of sites by these kinds of fake links. On one day the links all pointed to a site by Aliexpress, which is Alibaba&rsquo;s cross between Amazon and Ebay. It has a huge presence in Russia, and I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder if I&rsquo;ve found one of the tools it used to quickly built up such a dominant position&hellip;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We create each present moment by our past actions. The grip of this present moment is very difficult to escape, but most of the time no one cares. We are so busy planning for the future that a little discomfort now is nothing. Most see no reason to seek a different destiny until plans unravel as inimical fate takes over. Only then do we decide it is time to change. Unfortunately it takes greater wisdom than most have to figure out how to change for the better.</p>

<p>In the Vedic tradition of India, we are said to be trapped in the muddy fields of mundane existence. In case that makes no sense, I&rsquo;ll expand the analogy. I don&rsquo;t know if you have ever slogged across a sodden field, each step growing more difficult as a heavy mass of clay rich soil builds up on the bottom of your boots. If you stop to rest, the mud congeals together, locking your feet immobile to the ground. Imagine it is dark, with no obvious route to escape the mud. The unfortunate tendency is to wander around in circles, growing more and more tired until collapse is inevitable.</p>

<p>This is how the sages see the endless desires and attachments of the unenlightened&mdash;weights dragging them down from life to life&mdash;layers of attachment that make it painfully difficult to get past ignorance to enlightenment. Religions are <em>supposed</em> to be giving us that guidance, but for far too long they have failed their followers.</p>

<p>The problem is that each religion, which began by reviving the vision of spirit as a necessity for a fully meaningful life, became stuck filtering explanations of its traditions through a few representatives. Since people with intensely spiritual natures are usually extremely impractical, it ends up being non-spiritual managers who decide matters of doctrine. Because those choosing what points to teach are from among those most caught up in activity, it only takes a generation to lose the path of knowledge.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Inflation</h2>

<p>Back in the great depression, bankers were reviled. They either failed to preserve corporate assets and went bankrupt, thereby increasing the misery of the poor, or grimly held on to too much, thus increasing the misery of the poor. But bankers were reviled for their hold on money generations before that. They are sure to be seen as enemies of the poor for generations to come. Only the reasons change.</p>

<p>The first banks emerged from under the shadow of Church sponsored usury laws. People always need loans, and unscrupulous people with money to spare are always willing to lend, at least for a price. Back when lending for interest was illegal, lenders had few tools to get their money back when a deal soured. That led to a close connection between banks and criminal enforcers, one that endures, at least in public imagination. Jews were among the few not religiously forbidden to lend, starting the long tradition of Europe&rsquo;s Shylocks. For centuries Europeans distrusted their supposed hidden hand behind worldly affairs.</p>

<blockquote><p> &ldquo;Jewish usurers bleed the poor to death and grow fat on their substance, shall I see them robbed of what belongs to them and keep silent?&rdquo;<br> &mdash;Bernardin of Feltre, circa 1450 AD</p></blockquote>

<p>Once banking turned legal, control gradually became more widespread. Most bankers still worked for the family owning the money, earning little more than other clerks. Today the bonuses of top deal makers are stunning, making bankers the highest paid people in America.</p>

<p>For the last few decades there has been a growing disconnect between incomes of wage earners and the elite. Almost every society ends up this way, but America prides itself on its democratic leveling of society. The present reality of bankers as ultra rich hedge fund managers is bitter.</p>

<p>Because democracy depends on votes and it takes money (and a message, and a party affiliation) to persuade people to elect anyone, it is widely assumed that the average politician has been bought. No one can say exactly who has done the buying, but the wealth given lawmakers by bankers while lawmakers managed the financial crisis definitely puts them among the likely suspects. Curiously, what would be seen as a bribe elsewhere, in America is a legitimate political donation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most people noticed the recent collapse of oil prices. I followed it in excruciating detail, as I invested heavily in oil stocks that started out worth many times what they are today. I held onto them with grim determination throughout their rapid descent, as logic insisted that the price of oil could not fall this far.</p>

<p>I made one of the classic errors of investors. Belief that logic will win out is the enemy of speculation. The market follows emotion, and emotions can be tricked into wanting things injurious to life.</p>

<p>If I am to make that money back, I have to figure out what emotions investors will be feeling over the next few months. Knowing that, I can guess where the market is going and place better bets. I&rsquo;m going to do some thinking here, hoping to stumble into a useful answer.</p>

<p>The first thing to look at is the irrational beliefs that dominate the market. One of the most wide spread is the belief that production of oil has no limits. Unfortunately folks, there is a fixed amount of oil in the ground, and once it is gone, we are done. It would be nice to believe renewables will take oil&rsquo;s place, but wind has never been very good at pushing cars the direction we want.</p>

<p>People have faith that batteries will come to our rescue, forgetting the immense number needed would consume more lithium or lead than is available. Until we think of some brilliant alternative, our way of life depends on oil. Not that our way of life is necessarily a good one, but we haven&rsquo;t planned out realistic alternatives. And oil isn&rsquo;t getting any easier to get our hands on.</p>

<p>Actually, it is worse than that. Oil lurks in &lsquo;traps&rsquo; unless it is heavy oil lying near the surface waiting to leach into the environment. The remaining oil not in the middle east is either out at sea, otherwise hard to get at, or tight oil, the stuff that has to be fracked. This stuff is stuck in stone&mdash;usually shale&mdash;that is barely porous and hard to get it out of. That is why drillers have to shatter the trap under extraordinary pressure, then jam proppants into the cracks to keep them open.</p>

<p>Fracking is weird stuff, using millions of gallons of water along with mystery ingredients that dissolve difficult rocks or prevent stubborn bacteria or chemical deposits gumming things up. Weirdly enough, they also use guar gum as a gelling agent to hold proppant in solution (you many know it as an indigestible food additive.) The most fascinating items are radioactive tracer isotopes used to determine the location of fractures.</p>
