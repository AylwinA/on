  <div class="entry-content"><h2>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Inflation</h2>

<p>Back in the great depression, bankers were reviled. They either failed to preserve corporate assets and went bankrupt, thereby increasing the misery of the poor, or grimly held on to too much, thus increasing the misery of the poor. But bankers were reviled for their hold on money generations before that. They are sure to be seen as enemies of the poor for generations to come. Only the reasons change.</p>

<p>The first banks emerged from under the shadow of usury laws. People always need loans, and unscrupulous people with money to spare are always willing to lend, at least for a price. Back in those days when lending for interest was illegal, lenders had few tools to get their money back when a deal soured. That led to a close connection between banks and criminal enforcers that endures in the public imagination. Since Jews were among the few not religiously forbidden to lend, this also began a long tradition of them being Europe&rsquo;s bankers. This led to centuries of anger at their supposed hidden hand behind worldly affairs.</p>

<blockquote><p> &ldquo;Jewish usurers bleed the poor to death and grow fat on their substance, shall I see them robbed of what belongs to them and keep silent?&rdquo;<br> &mdash;Bernardin of Feltre, circa 1450 AD</p></blockquote>

<p>Once banking turned legal, control of banking gradually became more widespread. Most bankers still worked for the family owning the money, earning little more than other clerks. Today the bonuses of top deal makers are stunning, making bankers the highest paid people in America.</p>

<p>For the last few decades there has been a growing disconnect between incomes of wage earners and the elite. Almost every society ends up this way, but America prides itself on its democratic levelling of society. The present reality of bankers as ultra rich hedge fund managers is bitter.</p>

<p>Because democracy depends on votes and it takes money (and a message, and a party affiliation) to persuade people to elect anyone, it is widely assumed that the average politician has been bought. No one can say exactly who has done the buying, but the wealth given lawmakers by bankers while lawmakers managed the financial crisis of 2008 definitely puts them among the most likely suspects. It is curious how what would be considered a bribe under other circumstances. in America becomes a legitimate political donation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most people noticed the recent collapse of oil prices. I followed it in excruciating detail, as I invested heavily in oil stocks that started out worth many times what they are today. I held onto them with grim determination throughout their rapid descent, as logic insisted that the price of oil could not fall this far.</p>

<p>I made one of the classic errors of investors. Belief that logic will win out is the enemy of speculation. The market follows emotion, and emotions can be tricked into wanting things injurious to life.</p>

<p>If I am to make that money back, I have to figure out what emotions investors will be feeling over the next few months. Knowing that, I can guess where the market is going and place better bets. I&rsquo;m going to do some thinking here, hoping to stumble into a useful answer.</p>

<p>The first thing to look at is the irrational beliefs that dominate the market. One of the most wide spread is the belief that production of oil has no limits. Unfortunately folks, there is a fixed amount of oil in the ground, and once it is gone, we are done. It would be nice to believe renewables will take oil&rsquo;s place, but wind has never been very good at pushing cars the direction we want.</p>

<p>People have faith that batteries will come to our rescue, forgetting the immense number needed would consume more lithium or lead than is available. Until we think of some brilliant alternative, our way of life depends on oil. Not that our way of life is necessarily a good one, but we haven&rsquo;t planned out realistic alternatives. And oil isn&rsquo;t getting any easier to get our hands on.</p>

<p>Actually, it is worse than that. Oil lurks in &lsquo;traps&rsquo; unless it is heavy oil lying near the surface waiting to leach into the environment. The remaining oil not in the middle east is either out at sea, otherwise hard to get at, or tight oil, the stuff that has to be fracked. This stuff is stuck in stone&mdash;usually shale&mdash;that is barely porous and hard to get it out of. That is why drillers have to shatter the trap under extraordinary pressure, then jam proppants into the cracks to keep them open.</p>

<p>Fracking is weird stuff, using millions of gallons of water along with mystery ingredients that dissolve difficult rocks or prevent stubborn bacteria or chemical deposits gumming things up. Weirdly enough, they also use guar gum as a gelling agent to hold proppant in solution (you many know it as an indigestible food additive.) The most fascinating items are radioactive tracer isotopes used to determine the location of fractures.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the classic Zen koans asks &ldquo;if a tree falls in the forest and no one hears, does it make a sound?&rdquo; One&rsquo;s first reaction is to think this a stupid question. Sound is created by the falling tree, so there is no need for an observer.</p>

<p>To the Zen master, there may be sound, or there may not be sound. This depends on sound&rsquo;s reality being nothing but <em>an interpretation by a mind</em> of shock waves generated in the air by the tree. The question is asked of the student to help separate their mind&rsquo;s automatic and completely unnoticed interpretation of the world from the world&rsquo;s underlying reality.</p>

<p>What we believe to be real is our mind dealing with information from our senses. The first understanding of what is real, once we accept our mind and senses can easily create a false reality, is that what is real ought to be what caused our senses to react. But is that the fundamental reality? Following the logic of the koan, we come to realize we are neither the objects of experience nor what we experience. We are the experiencer. Only this is true. As Descartes put it: &ldquo;Cogito, ergo sum.&rdquo; In ordinary English, &ldquo;I think, therefore I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Descartes was attempting to find a foundation, a reality that could not be denied. He realized that all sense impressions were not a fundamental truth, just an experience. When we dream, afterwards&mdash;and only afterwards&mdash;we know the experience is false. When we are awake, what proof do we have have of this long drawn out experience being reality, and not just some greater illusion that will be followed by a greater afterwards?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>&ldquo;There are many temptations in this life, but cake is probably one of the biggest of them.&rdquo;
 &mdash;Alexander McCall Smith</p></blockquote>

<p>Today I baked four loaves of a traditional heavy, nutty fruitcake, totally free of the chemical excesses of maraschino cherries. In a few days I&rsquo;ll make an even healthier gluten free apricot fruitcake for my sister, who is far too busy to spend hours prepping all the fruit.</p>

<p>My digging out the recipes for Christmas cake is one the first signs of Christmas around here. An even more ominous sign is that a few days ago it snowed, a careful dusting of white over lawns and gardens, one that politely melted off paths and roads. The season is moving forward, days shortening, long, cold nights taking over more and more of life. It will be interesting to see what changes this winter brings.</p>

<p>Winter is a time of sleep for most of nature, a time of transformation, when the seeds of our future rest, waiting for a time when their sprouting will be safe. It seems natural to think of this as the end of the year, but is it fair to call it the start of a new one? Our calendar shows the year ending on December 31st, but this is a date picked almost at random.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Time has no divisions to mark its passage, there is never a thunder-storm or blare of trumpets to announce the beginning of a new month or year. Even when a new century begins it is only we mortals who ring bells and fire off pistols.&rdquo; <br>
&mdash;Thomas Mann</p></blockquote>
