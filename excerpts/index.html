  <h1>What this is:</h1>

<div class="excerpt-intro">
<em><p>A chapter from a book exploring esoteric parts of China. I spent months writing and researching it, then abandoned the results to Amazon and fate. Neither did my marketing for me. Eventually my friends suggested I put a little effort into promotion. This site represents a laid back advertising campaign&mdash;and an opportunity to rework the text.</p>

<p>Mindy claims the story will only get read if I emphasize miracles. I didn&#8217;t believe her at first and kept the story at least sort of believable. She turned out to be right. This time I&#8217;ll cut loose and see if <strong>that</strong> sparks any interest.</p>

<p>I plan to go through the book chapter by chapter, with one being polished on the site. When a chapter looks good enough I&#8217;ll save it, gradually reassembling the book from the updated parts. Eventually I&#8217;ll create a link so anyone can buy a copy.</p>

<p>If you think some aspect of the book needs work, feel free to leave your comments and suggestions at the bottom of the page.</p></em>

<h2 class="centered">Learning to Let Go</h2>




<div class="excerpt-hidden" id="ex-hidden">Stories about spirituality used to confuse me. Like most people, while scorning their impracticality, I couldn&#8217;t help wondering what was really going on. Then in my teens a friend learned to meditate. It drove me crazy not knowing what he was doing. When I finally got up the courage to learn, I immediately felt it was important. Even so, everyone kept insisting I didn&#8217;t need to do anything differently, I should just continue as I was. Not knowing what changes I could make, doing nothing seemed sensible.

Some can just add in a little meditation to whatever they do and manage to stick with it for the rest of their lives. Most gradually start skipping meditations until one day they discover they have quit. That would have been me, except one day, humiliated by yet another messed up relationship, I decided a full on spiritual path was my only chance to overcome my faults. It was time to learn to live in harmony with all of nature. Since I was a borderline Olympic level athlete I figured I had a huge advantage&mdash;that lofty goal should only take a year or two. It turned out significantly more difficult and time consuming than I&#8217;d imagined.

Years of adventures led me ever deeper into meditation, into being an increasingly skinny vegetarian, and eventually to the mountains of India. My experiences there were amazing, shattering deep misconceptions I&#8217;d wasted time and energy on for years. Unfortunately my focus on purification went overboard. I forgot that the ever present amoebas and parasites were challenging enough and ended up reduced to a shadow of my former health. At that point common sense finally returned and I fled to a healthier place. Considering the state of rural India, that could have been almost anywhere.

My refuge ended up Northern China, where I began teaching English at a University. I had no qualifications other than being able to speak English, knew no one, and didn&#8217;t speak a word of Mandarin. Within hours I realized I was in a spiritual desert. An extremely clean one, compared to India, but none the less a desert. One of the key supports for a spiritual life is living among like minded people. They were going to be hard to find.

After a few weeks I was delighted to discover two of my students had broken any number of party rules by learning to meditate. One I wanted to know better. She was in her twenties, with the round cheerful face common in China. The first time we hung out, she carefully explained that she had a long term boyfriend, but he was afraid of commitment. Then she sighed and told me she was thinking of making changes in her life. When she started calling me up late at night from the ‘English’ bar I finally began to suspect what those changes were.

She also dawdled when she walked, which drives me crazy. I&#8217;d once been ridiculously athletic and still prefer getting where I&#8217;m going, not floating around in a cloud of ambivalent niceness. She also lacked deep experiences in meditation, her father was a virtual monk with a bad temper and no English, and her master could only visit China illegally. All this discouraged me from relying on her for spiritual support. It was my suspicion that she wanted a foreign husband, almost any foreign husband, that threw me most.

The other meditator was Mindy. Thirty something and very good looking, she had the focussed attention that comes from years of studying Kung Fu. Unfortunately she wasn’t actually meditating. She&#8217;d studied Buddhism and knew how, but her current job was talking to dragons, then using their advice to help clients.

Yes, that really is what she did. I avoided her, figuring anyone that strange was bound to end up leading me astray.

Unfortunately she was a student, so I couldn&#8217;t completely ignore her. Besides, once I became aware of my other meditator&#8217;s marital ambitions, Mindy became my last bulwark against rampant materialism. So I let her talk me into doing things with her, and that somehow led to a trip that I knew from the start would be a disaster.

She insisted a distant, peaceful temple was the perfect place for me to enjoy deep meditation. The trouble was, the trip included two days of travel during golden week. This is a phenomenon completely unique to China and unimaginable to the rest of the world. Almost everyone in China is given a week off. Over 90 million of them insist on being part of a mass migration by train to visit family and friends.

To prevent a black market in tickets, they are only made available a few days before the celebration begins. Obviously there is no possible way everyone can get seats. As a concession to the millions who would miss out, the trains offer standing tickets. These are only for the cheaper cars, the ones with hard seats, ensuring they are jammed full. Many cars are ancient, briefly resuscitated for service during these days of intense travel. Many in the cars are peasants, laboring in the city the rest of the year and taking this heaven sent opportunity to get back home to see their children. They often travel in groups, with masses of heavy luggage, with food, with folding stools to sit in the aisles. They are ready for the adventure in ways a naive westerner could never be.

Mindy was proud of having somehow gotten three of us on one of those trains. She didn&#8217;t get us luxurious but expensive soft beds, the last places to sell out on a train. We weren&#8217;t in the sturdy but tightly packed hard bunks, or even an up market car with reclining soft seats. No, we were on a hard, unforgiving bench, on a slow train, surrounded by stoically standing passengers and their luggage, enduring a wall of bodies unavoidably encroaching on our space.

This was several years ago, so it is unfair to complain about the train not being fast. Back then high speed trains ran only in the south, although speed is a relative thing. China&#8217;s slow trains are usually faster than the best trains in North America, and in China they trundle directly, and often overnight, to every city centre&mdash;and everyone trusts them as the safest way to travel.

Regardless of the relative quality of the train, I spent the night jammed in a hard bench seat, Mindy asleep on one of my shoulders and her nine year old daughter asleep in my lap. I was stuck neither sleeping nor able to meditate. The one thing I was able to do was get grumpy. By the time the train stopped I was definitely not spreading joy. Then we had to hire a taxi to get to the temple, and after half an hour jolting through the countryside Mindy began chatting for what seemed like an hour with the woman running the farmhouse hostel at the gates of the temple.

I never get headaches, but I had a cracking one by the time Mindy was finished, and as a result the people around me were no longer enjoying life much either. Mindy ordered me to rest in the farmhouse and went off to manage our accommodations.

I grumbled at everything, including the bed&mdash;a massive brick slab that ran all the way down one side of the open plan farmhouse, forming a communal resting place that could hold a dozen sleepers stacked end on end, or a lot more if you didn&#8217;t mind crowding in a bit. There was no hope there of quiet, private meditation time. I wasn&#8217;t sure if its unyielding surface offered much hope for sleep, either. I lay down on a layer of thin quilts prepared to suffer.

When Mindy returned I was still grumpy, but at least slightly rested. She finally told me that only women were allowed to stay at the temple. Mindy is not one to tell you bad news in advance, always hoping she&#8217;ll figure a way around it. She&#8217;d been thinking to dump me in the hostel but after enduring my complaints parked her sister and daughter there instead. She somehow talked the temple into letting me use a one room shed half way up the mountain. It too had a brick bed heated by a tiny wood fire.

These hardest of possible beds are kàngs, which for centuries kept peasants and nobles alike warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Unfortunately there is a tradition in India that yogis never have fire inside their dwelling. I&#8217;m not really a yogi, but I can&#8217;t help trying. I let the kàng&#8217;s fire burn out and enjoyed fresher air&mdash;but a cold and very very hard bed.

Just in case the bed wasn&#8217;t challenge enough, the place was also missing any of the traditional parts of a washroom. To compound the problem, trail visitors used to hike up the mountain passed directly above the hut, with a very nice view of everything below. This made necessary outdoor showers and bathroom breaks more challenging than they needed to be. More than once I heard voices floating on the wind as I poured water over myself, and had to make a mad and very wet dash back to the shed. It wasn&#8217;t much good for meditation either. By the time I started sliding into deeper experiences, Mindy would turn up at my door insisting it was time to come out for a walk on the mountain.

The women who owned the temple were a also bit unusual. The junior partner had a technique for talking with spirits that was completely unique. She would stand at attention, then with no warning begin making strange noises deep in her throat. Her friend would wait next to her, head tilted as if listening intently, then begin translating the noises. In this way she explained that they had seen me coming days earlier, and they were very interested in what I had to say. I resisted telling them I found their story a little strange. I just agreed it was a very nice place, especially a group of four enormous old pines just across the road.

It turned out that there had been well known temples here in the old days, but in the cultural revolution fanatical youths had come through and smashed everything. One young stud had even taken an axe to the roots of the largest tree because the grove was supposed to be holy. He only did it once&mdash;he was so shocked by the results that he immediately fled.

I dragged Mindy over to check out the trees but she was distracted. I put my hands on the biggest trunk and invited it to share energies. A big healthy tree can share a lot of energy when there is enough sun for it to be fully awake. Mindy continued to be disinterested.

It wasn&#8217;t until much later that I learned this was her standard response to my asking questions&mdash;and I&#8217;m always asking questions. She would stare off into space looking bored, leaving me convinced she was ignoring me. In reality she was busy checking for an answer with her spirits. To listen to me she had to disengage with them, making them unhappy with her. This naturally led to many misunderstandings&mdash;on this trip I got my first hint there was a problem when she kept scolding me for asking too many questions. Having no clue what was actually going on, I figured I&#8217;d better stop talking. Typical male reaction, right?

Rather than risk talking any more, to prove that something interesting was going on I left one hand on the tree and put the other on her back, figuring she would notice the energy. After a while she finally became aware something was happening. To my surpise she wasn&#8217;t pleased. After she got home it took several visits to her master to fix her energy flow. At this point our lack of appreciation was becoming mutual, but at least temple life became amusing.

The staff included a cream colored cat they swore was the reincarnation of one of the old monks. It strolled down to the gate to meet every new arrival, then escorted them back to the office. They also had a stream of visitors anxious to learn whatever they could. One had recently attracted a spirit but couldn&#8217;t get it to do anything useful. After discovering Mindy managed a whole slew of them he pestered her to teach him. Unfortunately he failed to offer any money. This is a terrible offence among those who work with spirits.

Small spirits in China are often called foxes, and can be jealous creatures as well as dangerously unreliable. Their sources of information are small, but to impress the person they&#8217;ve attached themselves to, those foxes who aren&#8217;t completely selfish gather whatever records they can. Spirits incur debts doing this, one the person asking the questions must pay. One way or another. If it doesn&#8217;t come out through money, it will end up being paid through pain and suffering.

This is the heart of the conflict between Buddhists and Animists. Buddhist Pusas are exalted beings with deep knowledge and connections, and no interest in material things. All they care about is the sincerity of those who petition for help. Even worse, the help they give can make the petitioner&#8217;s material desires impossible to achieve. Unfortunately Pusas know better than we do what is good for us.

Most animists don&#8217;t get attention from a Pusa and wouldn&#8217;t like it if they did. Mindy is among the rare few interested in all levels of spirits. It was one reason she wanted me around&mdash;she discovered higher spirits would talk to her when I was there. It wasn&#8217;t my wit they liked, just the side effects of decades of long meditation.

The foxes of the animists are local nature spirits, of no real significance. These weak spirits are about as high as most animists get. Foxes care deeply about what is in it for themselves. Sincerity doesn&#8217;t count for much.

Mindy never did help the guy deal with his foxes, growing increasingly irritated with him as the week passed. I ended up the only one making suggestions. They probably weren&#8217;t appreciated&mdash;my position on spirits is that you are better off ignoring them. For most of us, the state of mind that allows us to experience spirits is so close to the dream space that nothing recalled afterwards is at all reliable. Even if you could recall everything word for word, spirits can have a unique view of &#8216;truth&#8217; that fits badly with ours. This is probably why the Vedas counsel seekers to &#8216;avoid disincarnate teachers.&#8217;

A couple of days before we left I discovered the region was suffering from a serious drought. Since the women running the place were Animists they decided to have a ceremony to encourage their foxes to bring rain. They did it in a tiny temple they had built just far enough away from the Buddhist temples to keep purists happy.

Naturally no one told me until after they were done. Bah. Anyway, it sounded sensible to me to encourage nature a bit. The next time I was supposed to be innocently meditating, instead I slipped into deep silence, to that pathless place where it is possible to feel influences on weather. This is not something I can explain, but once you get there it is dead easy. I stumbled onto the trick as a child, so you know it has to be simple.

Just in case you think this is something you ought to experiment with, it isn&#8217;t. Every place gets the weather its people earn by their collective actions. Changing that weather is not a good idea. When the weather is altered, life itself changes. What sensible person takes on the karma of others? In childhood it can be excused. As an adult, it is awfully close to hubris.

This danger is easy to understand from a philosophical approach, but I learned by meddling. While still very young I&#8217;d been annoyed one year to discover we were yet again having a wet Christmas. I spent several days organizing a monster snowstorm, only to panic when I finally saw a massive wall of clouds approaching. I sent it south, where overnight almost two feet of snow plunged life into chaos. Next day I was horrified to read in the paper that people had died in the storm. I vowed to never do a major weather event again. Over time I&#8217;ve found my definition of major event tends to depend on how annoying local weather is being&mdash;and sometimes I&#8217;m not even aware I&#8217;m changing it.

Once as I was finishing meditation I overheard my next-door neighbour telling a friend not to worry about getting wet&mdash;it never rained in the morning. He was at a loss to explain why, but it was clear to me. I didn&#8217;t like walking to work in the rain. I felt so guilty that next week I let a really nasty storm in. Gusts of wind drove the rain almost horizontal and managed to destroy my brand new umbrella&mdash;irritating, but it left me feeling I&#8217;d paid my dues for meddling.

You may be thinking that this is a unique skill. Not so. Back in feudal times, there were many in the east who spent much of their lives doing exactly that. Milarepa was one such, from a family tradition of sorcerers who brought good weather on hire&mdash;but given his own terrible luck, was more often asked to bring disasters on behalf of those seeking revenge. He eventually realized his future was becoming dark, so went to study under the most enlightened teacher then in China.

Among the terrible tasks he was set as penance, he had to bring a storm to destroy the crops of a village that had insulted his teacher. The woman whose house he was staying in saw wild weather coming and ran to Milarepa, begging him not to destroy her livelihood. Milarepa had her draw her plot of land in the dirt, then put his hand over the map. One small corner of her field was not covered by his hand&mdash;the storm destroyed the crops on all but what Milarepa&#8217;s hand covered.

Although I have nothing like Milarepa&#8217;s skills, one afternoon while in Indonesia I had the idea that I could make money by offering to make rain for the dessicated kingdoms of the middle east. I began exploring their weather patterns and discovered it really wouldn&#8217;t take much to bring rain. As I was checking things out I realized I couldn&#8217;t just look&mdash;my attention was already making changes. Startled, I quickly ended the experiment. A week or so later I heard from my brother who worked there that rain was falling for the first time in years.

Meddling with weather is fun, but stupid. Disregarding the faint twinge from common sense that told me to leave things alone, I settled into the silence of my mountain hut, and once there searched around for rain to invite. There was nothing to the east, where I expected it to be lurking. There was nothing south either. I started getting discouraged when I found nothing west. Finally I found a trace of rain to the north and invited it to come down. It complained that it was busy there. I waited until it relented, then got back to the quiet meditation I was supposed to be doing.

Mindy arrived all to soon to drag me off to lunch. She immediately passed my story on to the women of the temple. It turned out north was where they expected rain to come from. Apparently they get their clouds from Siberia. Anyway, in my experience weather takes three days to arrive unless it is really stuck, when it can take a week or more to shake things loose. We only had high cloud cover as we left, but from the reports I got, it was still drizzling weeks later. I think maybe having both of us ask was overdoing it a bit&#8230;.

Staying there was by donation, and Mindy told me how much she thought they deserved and took care of giving it to them. As we were leaving their office manager rushed out to scold me for being a cheapskate. Apparently some businessman had stayed there just before me and they were hoping for similar munificence. We climbed into the cab to start the trip back surrounded by good wishes from everyone but the manager.

Unfortunately the train ride back ended up even more nightmarish than the trip down. Although Mindy&#8217;s sister got me a sleeper ticket&mdash;hooray!&mdash;they were unable to get anything but a standing ticket for Mindy. I didn&#8217;t think it would be a problem, especially since she was barely speaking to me. She was annoyed that no seats were available, and that I&#8217;d met friends in the train station. She glowered at everyone, radiating discontent.

She ended up standing in another car and I have to confess I looked forward to a comfortable trip with more charming company. Unfortunately Mindy&#8217;s daughter had left a couple of days earlier but had only travelled half way home. It turned out she was going to be waiting on the platform for our train&mdash;Mindy&#8217;s unpleasant surprise on the trip back.

By the time I got home, if it hadn&#8217;t been for nagging thoughts about needing spiritual people around me, I would have avoided Mindy completely. As it happened, she got creative and suggested we meet with her master, Little Buddha. I delayed as much as I could on ethical issues. On top of my habit of ignoring good advice, I refuse to  trust anyone who claims to know the deepest secrets of life. I’m even less inclined to consult them if they call themselves a ‘Master’, promoting their position as a final authority.

Mindy insisted the translation was wrong. Furthermore, she explained, there was no implied commitment&mdash;I needn&#8217;t actually follow Little Buddha’s suggestions. Besides, she lived nearby, and the appointment was already made. So I was dragged, feebly protesting, into a taxi to meet Little Buddha. She had studied in Tibet and was said to be able to see deeply into anyone’s past. Even better, she had a reputation for helping people take charge of their own unique path to enlightenment.

We got out in the business district where Little Buddha lives, then cut through an unobtrusive grey alley carved out of the front of an otherwise impressive looking shop. From there we ended up in a dead end courtyard jammed full of derelict looking sheds housing small businesses. Mindy led me up a flight of decrepit concrete stairs, across a balcony, and into a short hallway. The first door turned out to be Little Buddha’s tiny apartment, her bedroom window overlooking one of the busiest streets in the city.

We met in the quieter side of her suite, facing that dismal courtyard, the only view the grey concrete masses of eight story tall walk up apartments. There wasn’t a speck of green. It wasn’t pretty, but it sure was typical of that part of town. A sensible person would have wondered how any trace of spirituality could survive in that environment. I sat down to see what I could learn.

Mindy and I perched on tiny stools while Little Buddha sat on her daughter’s bed. I hoped they were discussing ways to speed up my progress. She and Mindy chattered away in Mandarin for ages, until Mindy reluctantly broke off for a sketchy translation. First she listed spiritual leaders I had been in the past. This part seems de rigueur among Buddhists, as if they are helpfully establishing your credentials.

They told me how important my past lives had been&mdash;I suspected I must have made a lot of bad choices in those lives to not yet be enlightened&mdash;and then they told me not to tell anyone else. Name dropping is not a class act even when you actually know the people owning the names. Name dropping from some possible and long forgotten past is about as foolish as you can get&mdash;I was happy to agree.

Then she began telling me where we should go. It turns out Chinese tradition demands visiting holy places to earn points towards enlightenment. Little Buddha knew about my previous travels. She figured if I visited three more holy spots I’d earn myself some kind of breakthrough.

It was already October, which is an ideal time to visit southern China, but not practical for getting leave from work. Left to myself, I would have prevaricated, and the trip would never have happened. However at that point my Mom finally admitted she was scheduled for surgery and would need someone to look after her. Mindy persuaded me our journey should be squeezed in before a trip home to help her recover.

Some people just never learn. But then, they don’t have adventures either. I figured I had acquired enough survival skills that I was capable of handling Mindy. I was wrong, but not as wrong as before. And mistakes are how we learn.

In China, the great places of pilgrimage are mountains. There are five principle ones for Taoists, four for Buddhists, and an enormous host of less popular crags with smaller and often sadly neglected temples. They may not make the list of immortal temples, yet a few of those humbler places still draw half a million visitors a year to petition for celestial favors. Those pilgrims spend generously.

After my time in India I was shocked at how wealthy Chinese temples can be. Some of the largest are state treasures, run by the government with hired monks working there as their day job. Weird.  Stranger still, many of the smaller, newly re-built temples are for profit enterprises run by investors on the same basis.

It was even more shocking to discover that, under the communist party&#8217;s guidance, monks had been persuaded to give up celibacy. The choice offered back in revolutionary days had been simple&mdash;encourage marriage or be banned. The followers of the Tao always married, but as China slips farther and farther from zealous communism, celibacy has been re-emerging among the ranks of increasingly devoted (but often overly intellectual) Buddhists.

The holiness of China&#8217;s sites may not be what it was, but four of China&#8217;s holiest mountains are a day’s travel from Shanghai. My first thought was to start from there. It would be a natural stop for a trip home, and I&#8217;d never have to admit I was sneaking off early to do some illicit tourism.

My plan was to start by heading from Shanghai to a nearby island called Pǔtuóshān, roughly translated as Rugged Mountain. A strange name for a place that is a mere bump in the ocean, but pilgrimage spots must be called mountains. Turns out in China: “A mountain is famous not for its height, but for its holiness.” That whole island is sacred to Guānyīn Púsà, the embodiment of compassion. (With the unfortunate exception of some of the hotels, whose owners are among the most avaricious in China) Guānyīn is the protector of women and children, the champion of the sick, the disabled, and the poor.

The idea was to visit her island, then loop up to Jiǔhuáshān, or Nine Flowers Mountain. That set of peaks is considered the home of Dìzàng Púsà. He goes anywhere to help those in need. His qualities include unflagging optimism, fearlessness, and gentleness. Even better, he never abandons anyone who calls on him for help.

Not a bad trip, and one we could do at a leisurely pace so I could actually squeeze my meditations in. It didn’t take Mindy long to get on her computer and began researching other travel options. I soon discovered we had two more spots to visit and we weren’t starting out in Shanghai. Sandwiched in between our spiritual adventures would be a visit to the most famous tourist mountain in all of China, Huángshān, or Yellow Mountain. We’d also make a stop at the jewel of China’s literary past, West Lake, ancient home of the immortal White Snake. Through incomparable skill in the Tao, this delightful reptile had lived among the people as a great lady.

So much for an easy trip. While we were still going to fly to get started, my job didn’t pay well enough to let us travel first class. Fortunately Mindy&#8217;s idea of an interesting trip, as you may have gathered, is to head out on the infamous hard seats of slow trains or on the only slightly more comfortable seats of long distance buses. If you&#8217;ve done this kind of travel you&#8217;ll know it palls quickly. It gets unbearable when you have a lot of luggage. Everything in one backpack became my goal.

In the weeks before I left I hunted for a pack that could double as a suitcase and had wheels. I&#8217;m still not sure why I wanted the extra weight and awkwardness of wheels, but it helpfully reduced the number of choices I had to look at. Eventually I found a gorgeous silver one, with a special compartment underneath for shoes and all kinds of compartments inside, including one for a laptop. They only wanted $70 for this beautiful thing. It had my name all over it.

After much discussion, everyone helping me agreed. It was much too expensive. And I wasn&#8217;t going to carry a heavy computer anyway. They insisted we keep looking until they found one costing a third of that. With everyone now fully approving, I was urged to ignore how small it was and how much space was taken up by the frame. We also ignored the hard plastic base that would bite into my back during a long days trek.

They were all delighted. Everyone ignored the bright red color and the funny handle that stuck out the top like an antenna. They knew I wasn’t trying to look cool. They were all so enthused it was easier just to buy the dratted thing.

Things were quickly getting organized, probably far too organized, yet I still hadn&#8217;t cleared the trip with my boss. I finally got around to sending an off-hand message to her assistant&mdash;my excuse was that he had much better English and I didn&#8217;t want to challenge her understanding. Within an hour she was at my desk demanding an explanation for my not asking directly. She quickly agreed to time off work to help my Mom, but I was still too embarrassed to mention that I was slipping off early to visit temples.

Then a week before we were due to leave I learned my boss had arranged a car and a good number of people from the office would be going to the airport to see me off. Nice gesture, but it would be incredibly obvious that I wasn&#8217;t flying straight back home. Instead I was flying to an insignificant city (a mere million people) that happened to be three hours by bus from the first mountain I was going to visit.

As if that wasn’t bad enough, I was travelling with Mindy. And while Mindy likes to help people, and while doing so can be kindness personified, in emergencies she transforms into a human bulldozer, completely devoid of tact. You&#8217;ll remember the disaster of our first trip? I&#8217;d better back up and give a little more detail.

Mindy had ended up returning on the same train, but with a standing ticket. She was off in another coach, heading to visit her cousin. Her daughter had gone to visit that cousin a few days earlier, but would miss school unless she travelled back that night. I suspect her cousin was also told to get that ticket a little too late, so only another standing ticket was available.

Long past the last possible minute to arrange things Mindy let me know I was nominated as chaperone for a child who would be standing by herself in the aisles. Which you will probably agree is not something you ask a nine year old to do on an overnight trip.

Mindy sent a text to her daughter, ordering her to run up to me on the platform and display such extravagant affection that everyone would assume I was her long lost father. Then she sent a text to my boss’s niece, Xiǎo Wáng, who I&#8217;d had the good luck to meet in the waiting room before boarding. I know, the odds for that happening seem awfully small, but this is how my life works. She had been visiting her husbands family, and they live an hour the other way from the temple.

We were approaching Mindy&#8217;s stop when Xiǎo Wáng read the text. I have never seen Xiǎo Wáng more furious. After hurling her cell phone across the carriage and cursing with abandon, she somehow cooled off enough to insist on standing outside with me to collect Mindy&#8217;s daughter. Then, when the conductor followed rules and wouldn’t let a little girl with no real ticket in our car, Xiǎo Wáng joined me jammed in the aisles of a hard seat car with hordes of impoverished seatless passengers, patiently lobbying the hapless conductor while the nine year old silently pleaded with huge sad eyes.

Every time I tried to say something comforting, the little waif would turn back and impatiently hush me. The two of them worked over that poor conductor in ways I could never imagine.
After an hour of this the conductor got her boss to allow a few broken rules. Mindy’s daughter got to stay with us, but Xiǎo Wáng never forgave Mindy. Being a &#8216;bad mother&#8217; is one of the ultimate sins in China. And guess who was organizing the office car?

Knowing they would think I was crazy, I decided it was time to admit to my boss I was sneaking away early for a temple tour. I found myself explaining that I planned to get Guānyīn Púsà’s blessings for my Mother. She was getting a second hip operation, you see, after her first implant had broken up. Nobody wanted the operation to go wrong. While the thought of getting some blessings for her had been there, it wasn&#8217;t one I wanted to admit to. When I did, to my surprise the tradition of respect for parents overcame modern insistence on practicality.

Having survived that awkward moment, I had to explain to Xiǎo Wáng about Mindy; she was there because I needed a real Buddhist along with me. Well, to be honest, I needed someone who spoke Chinese. I barely spoke enough to buy food at street stalls, where you can point at what you want. And solo travel is not simple in China. This was obvious to everyone: no Mindy, no China tour.  Xiǎo Wáng&#8217;s glower made it clear she still thought I was nuts, but at least she didn’t scold me. She just spent the afternoon quietly sniffing whenever she saw me. There was no reaction from anyone else in the office either, leaving me wondering if they&#8217;d given up on me.
