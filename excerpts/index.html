  <p>Below is a chapter from a book I wrote about some of my challenging travels in China. I spent months writing and researching it, then abandoned the results to fate. Fate wasn&rsquo;t particularly interested. Eventually my friends suggested I put a little effort into marketing it. This site actually represents both a lazy person&rsquo;s angle for marketing and an opportunity to rework the text.</p>

<p>I plan to go through the book chapter by chapter, with only the chapter being polished ever on the site. When a chapter looks good enough to me, I&rsquo;ll save it, gradually reassembling the book from the updated parts. When the book itself looks the way I want it to, I&rsquo;ll create a link so anyone can buy a copy.</p>

<p>What, you thought I&rsquo;d give it away? Honestly, it will be a good book and worth the price. Especially if you help out.</p>

<p>Feel free to leave your comments and suggestions below.</p>

<h2 class="centered">Learning to travel in China</h2>


<p><article class="excerpt-words">
When I was young I sometimes encountered stories about great spiritual masters from our distant past. People who hear those stories rarely become awed. Most heap scorn on their pious impracticality. Having started life on the wrong foot I decided the spiritual path was the best opportunity to make up for my faults. I was determined to learn to live in harmony with all of nature.</p>

<p>Years of adventures led me to meditation, to becoming vegetarian, eventually to India, and while there to picking up just enough Hindi to get by. My experiences were amazing, shattering deep misconceptions I’d wasted time and energy on for years. Unfortunately, in my focus on purification, I went overboard, forgetting that the ever present amoebas and parasites were challenging enough. I ended up reducing my body to a shadow of its former health. At that point common sense finally returned and I fled to a healthier place.</p>

<p>That place somehow ended up being Northern China, where I found myself teaching English at a University. I went with no qualifications other than being able to speak English, not knowing anyone, and not speaking a word of Mandarin. Within hours I realized I was in a spiritual desert. An extremely clean one, compared to India, but none the less a desert.</p>

<p>After a few weeks I was delighted to find that two of my students had broken any number of party guidelines to learn meditation. One I immediately wanted to know. One was in her early twenties, with the plump cheerful face common in China. The first time we hung out, she carefully explained that she had a long term boyfriend, but he was afraid of commitment. Then she sighed and suggested she was willing to make changes in her life. When she started calling me up late at night from the ‘English’ bar I began to suspect what those changes were.</p>

<p>She also lacked deep experiences in meditation, her father was a virtual monk with a terrible temper and no English, and her master made a habit of visiting China illegally. All this meant there was no way I was going get any spiritual pointers. It was more likely I’d be caught up in family storms.</p>

<p>The other meditator was Mindy. Thirty something and very determined, she had the focused attention that comes with years of studying Kung Fu. Added to that, she was gorgeous, and happy to tell me which actress she was a dead ringer for. I eventually learned that she wasn’t actively meditating. She merely studied Buddhism and knew how. Instead, her spare time was spent talking to dragons and helping female clients deal with personal problems. For months I avoided her, figuring she’d end up leading me astray.</p>

<p>She somehow managed to talk me into a trip that I knew from the start would be a disaster. She insisted a distant, peaceful temple would be the perfect place for me to enjoy deep meditation. The trouble was, the trip included two days of ungodly travel during golden week. This is a phenomenon completely unique to China. Almost everyone in the whole country is given the whole week off, and insists on being part of a mass migration back to their old family homes.</p>

<p>Millions of people rush for tickets on the trains. To prevent an organized black market in tickets, they are only made available a few days before the celebration begins. Obviously there is no possible way everyone can get seats. As a concession to the millions who would miss out, the trains offer standing room tickets, ensuring the cheaper cars, the ones with hard seats, are jammed full.</p>

<p></article></p>

<hr>


<p><article class="excerpt-words">
Mindy was proud of having somehow gotten three of us on the train. She didn&rsquo;t get soft beds, or hard bunks, or even soft seats. No, they were hard, unforgiving seats on a slow train. The ones with all the stoicly standing extra passengers.</p>

<p>This was several years ago, so it would be a little unfair to complain about it not being a fast train. Back then they were all slow. Well, speed is a relative thing. Even China&rsquo;s slow trains are faster than trains in North America, and in China they still go directly to every city centre&mdash;and everyone still uses them.</p>

<p>We ended up crammed into a hard bench seat, Mindy asleep on one of my shoulders and her eight year old daughter asleep in my lap. I was neither asleep nor able to meditate. The one thing I was able to do was get grumpy. By the time the train stopped I was definitely not enjoying life. Then we had to hire a taxi to get to the temple, and once there Mindy talked for what seemed like an hour with the woman who ran a farmhouse hostel by the temple. I never get headaches, but I had a cracking one by the time she finished, and the people around me were no longer enjoying life. Mindy ordered me to rest in the farmhouse and went off to manage things.</p>

<p>It turned out only women can stay at the temple. Ming talked them into letting me use a one room shed well up the hill. It had a brick bed heated by a wood fire. Unfortunately there is a tradition in India that yogis never have fire inside their dwelling, so I was stuck with a cold place to sleep. Among other challenges, the place was also missing any of the traditional parts of a toilet, and the trail up the hill was directly above the hut. This made impromptu outdoor showers and bathroom breaks more challenging than they needed to be. It wasn&rsquo;t much good for meditation either. By the time I started sliding into deeper experiences, Ming would turn up at my door insisting it was time to come out and hike in the mountain.</p>

<p>The trip back was even more nightmarish than the trip down. Mindy&rsquo;s sister got me a sleeper ticket&mdash;hooray&mdash; but Mindy was unable to get anything but a standing ticket for her daughter, and she would end up travelling back by herself. In order to get her daughter into my compartment I had to spend considerable time huddled on the floor of a car jammed full of standees, negotiating with a very kind conductress who herself was having to negotiate with the higher ups. After all the discomfort and lost sleep on that trip I was seriously reluctant to travel with Mindy ever again.</p>

<p>She got creative and suggested we meet with her master, Little Buddha, to see what advice she had for me. When we finally did meet, it was almost a year after I first meet Ming. I blame that delay on ethical issues. On top of my habit of ignoring ordinary good advice, I refuse to entirely trust anyone who is said to know the deepest secrets of life. I’m even less inclined to consult someone if they claim themselves a ‘master’, or final authority.</p>

<p>Ming insisted the translation was wrong. Furthermore, she explained, there was no implied commitment to following Little Buddha’s possibly outlandish path. Besides, she lived nearby, and the appointment was already made. So I was dragged, feebly protesting, into a taxi to meet Little Buddha.</p>

<p>She had studied in Tibet and was said to be able to see deeply into anyone’s past. Even better, she had a reputation for helping people take charge of their own unique path to enlightenment.

<p><article class="excerpt-words">
We got out in the business district where she lives, then cut through an unobtrusive grey alley carved into the front of a building. From there we ended up in a dead end courtyard jammed full of derelict looking sheds owned by small businesses. Ming led me up a flight of decrepit stairs, across a balcony, and into a short hallway. The first door turned out to be for Little Buddha’s tiny apartment, her bedroom window overlooking one of the busiest streets in the city.</p>

<p>We met in the quieter side of her suite, facing that closed square, the only view the grey concrete masses of eight story walk up apartments. There wasn’t a speck of green. It wasn’t pretty, but it sure was typical of that part of town. A sensible person would have wondered how any trace of spirituality could survive in that environment. I sat down to see what I could learn.</p>

<p>Ming and I perched on tiny stools while Little Buddha sat on her daughter’s bed. I understood they were discussing ways to speed up my progress. She and Ming chattered away in Mandarin for ages, until Ming reluctantly broke off for a sketchy translation. First she listed important spiritual leaders I had been in the past. This part seems to be de rigueur among Buddhists, as if they are helpfully establishing your credentials.</p>

<p>Then she began telling me where we were going. It turns out Chinese tradition demands visiting holy places to earn points towards enlightenment. Little Buddha knew all about our previous trip. She figured if I visited two more holy spots maybe I’d earn myself some kind of breakthrough.</p>

<p>Some people just never learn. But then, they don’t have adventures either. I decided that I had acquired enough survival skills that I was finally capable of handling Ms. Willful Ming. I was wrong, but not as wrong as before. And mistakes are how most of us learn.</p>

<p>In China, the great places of pilgrimage are mountains. There are five principle ones for Daoists, four for Buddhists, and an enormous host of lesser crags with smaller and often sadly neglected temples. They may not rate, yet a few of those humbler temples still draw half a million visitors a year to petition for celestial favors.</p>

<p>Two of China&rsquo;s four holiest mountains are a long day’s travel from Shanghai, so our first thought was to start from there. We’d head south to a nearby island called Pǔtuóshān, roughly translated as Rugged Mountain. A strange name for an island, but pilgrimage spots must be mountains. Turns out the name reflects an adage: “A mountain is famous not for its height, but for its holiness.”</p>

<p>The whole island is sacred to Guānyīn Púsà, the embodiment of compassion. She is the protector of women and children, the champion of the sick, the disabled, and the poor. Our plan was to visit her island, then loop up to Jiǔhuáshān, or Nine Splendors Mountain. That set of peaks is considered the home of Dìzàng Púsà, a being who plunges fearlessly into any place or situation to help those in need. His qualities include unflagging optimism, fearlessness, and gentleness. Even better, he never abandons anyone who calls on him for help.

At least that was how I understood our itinerary. It didn’t take Ming long to get on her computer and began researching other travel options. I soon discovered we had two more spots to visit and we weren’t starting out in Shanghai. Sandwiched in between our spiritual adventures would be a visit to the most famous tourist mountain in all of China, Huángshān, or Yellow Mountain. From there we’d make a stop at the jewel of China’s literary past, West Lake, ancient home of Lady White Snake.</p>

<p>My job was satisfying, but it didn’t pay well enough to let us travel first class. Fortunately Ming was not expecting much. Her idea of an interesting trip is to head out on the infamous hard seats of slow trains or on the only slightly more comfortable seats of long distance buses. If you&rsquo;ve done this kind of travel you&rsquo;ll know it palls quickly when you have a lot of luggage. Everything in one backpack became my goal.</p>

<p>In the weeks before I left I hunted for a pack that could double as a suitcase and had wheels. I&rsquo;m still not sure why I wanted the extra weight and awkwardness of wheels, but it sure reduced the number I could look at. Eventually I found a gorgeous silver one, with a special compartment underneath for shoes and all kinds of compartments inside, including one for a computer. They wanted a whole $70 for this beautiful thing.</p>

<p>After much discussion, everyone helping me agreed. It was much too expensive. And I didn&rsquo;t want to carry a heavy computer anyway. So we kept looking until we found one costing a third of that. With everyone now fully approving, I ignored how small it was and how much space was taken up by the frame. After all, small was the whole idea. Big is heavy, and a real nuisance when travelling. I also ignored the bright red color and the funny handle that stuck out the top like an antenna. After all, I wasn’t trying to look cool. I was trying to make travel easier</p>

<p>It was already October, which is an ideal time to visit southern China, but not practical for getting leave from work. At that point my Mom finally admitted she had health problems. Our journey was going to be squeezed in before a trip home to help her recover from a major operation.</p>

<p>Officially meeting my boss to arranging time off work, I was too embarrassed to mention that I was slipping off to visit temples. Yet a week before we were due to leave I learned they had arranged a car and a good number of people from the office would be going to the airport to see me off. It would be incredibly obvious that I wasn&rsquo;t flying straight back home through Beijing. I wasn&rsquo;t even flying via Shanghai. I was flying to an insignificant city of a mere million people that happened to be three hours by bus from the first mountain I was going to visit.

<p><article class="excerpt-words">
As if that wasn’t bad enough, I was traveling with Ming. And while Ming likes helping people, in emergencies she transforms into a human bulldozer, completely devoid of tact. On our first trip Ming abandoned me half way through our return trip so she could visit her cousin. Her nine year old daughter was halfway home, but would miss classes unless she travelled back with me. Well past the last possible minute to arrange things properly Ming let me know I was nominated as chaperone. Unfortunately her cousin had no time to book a ticket. During golden week, when the only way to get on a train without a reservation is by standing in the aisles. Which you will probably agree is not something you ask a nine year old to do by herself on an overnight trip.</p>

<p>Ming sent a text to her daughter Qing, ordering her to run up to me on the platform and display such extravagant affection that everyone would assume I was her long lost father. Then she sent the same text to my boss’s niece, Xiǎo Wáng, who by chance alone was with me on that train. I have never seen Xiǎo Wáng as furious as when she read Ming’s text. After hurling her cell phone across the carriage and cursing with abandon, she somehow cooled off enough to agree to stand outside with me to collect Qing. Then, when the conductor followed rules and wouldn’t let Qing in our car, Xiǎo Wáng joined me standing in the aisles among the hordes of often impoverished seatless passengers, patiently lobbying the hapless conductor while Qing stared at her with huge sad eyes. Half an hour of this overcame all resistance, and the conductor agreed to break the rules and let Ming’s daughter stay with us. And this was the girl who was organizing the office car.</p>

<p>Knowing they would think I was crazy, I carefully explained my temple tour. It sounded so lame I found myself claiming it would get Guānyīn Púsà’s blessings for my Mother. I was hoping the tradition of respect for parents would overcome modern insistence on practicality. Having managed that awkward moment, I then had to explain to Xiǎo Wáng why Ming was coming with me. She obviously thought I had no judgement about women, but at least she didn’t scold me. She just quietly sniffed. There wasn’t much other obvious reaction, leaving me convinced they were all giving up on me for being so foolish.</p>

<p>At this point I remembered I needed vegetarian snacks for the trip. The only vegetarian food store I knew was a little shop across the street from the local Buddhist temple. No one there spoke English and my Mandarin didn’t let me ask any questions about what they sold. Fortunately most of their stuff was from Hong Kong so the labels were English. Better yet, the shop girls were all friendly. Saying zhège (this one) and pointing worked like a charm. I soon had a basketful of bland tofu based emergency rations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I was running late and had to rush out of the store to get home. Twenty feet from the door a stranger approached me — as in India, beggars love temples, and can be counted on to lie  in wait, ready to try any trick for a little cash. Especially from a westerner, a person so obviously rich. Whoever he was, he tried to stop me, but when I ignored him he hustled off.

<p><article class="excerpt-words">
I was relieved, assuming he&rsquo;d given up, but as soon as I rounded the corner, he was in my face again, walking backwards so he could talk to me while trying to push something into my arms. I was wary of the old trick of &lsquo;giving&rsquo; you something and then demanding payment. I tried to sidle around him while holding a hand up to ward him off. He kept trying to give me whatever it was. I kept saying méiyǒu, thinking I was telling him I didn’t want it. Unfortunately it turns out to mean “don’t have”, which was unlikely to dissuade anyone. Some time later a sulking Qing to accidentally teach me a more effective way to convey disinterest: Ten minutes of her chanting búyào seared that phrase into my even my feeble memory.</p>

<p>At any rate, when the pursuing local saw I wasn’t responding, he had a brilliant idea. He pulled open my jacket, pushed the thing inside, then let go. Unfortunately, gravity is just as effective outside a temple as elsewhere. The object unexpectedly slipped through my coat to the ground and landed with a sickening crunch. I looked down and saw that between us we&rsquo;d just shattered a large ceramic statue. One of Guānyīn Púsà, the same being who’s island I was planning to visit.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the sensible thing is when you&rsquo;ve just done something that stupid, but I figured I knew who to ask. I called Ming and told her to check with Little Buddha. After being thoroughly scolded for my failed attempt to speak Mandarin, she finally agreed to talk to Little Buddha. Who just happened to work as a cook at that temple.</p>

<p>On her instructions, I ended up buying a replacement statue for the local monks and paying for the monks to do a ceremony to appease Guānyīn Púsà. After that everything was supposed to be fine. I wasn&rsquo;t convinced, especially since the process cost me much more than the original statue would have. And the guy apparently was just trying to give me a gift. This was both a lousy omen and an even worse reflection on my openness to adventure. And it had another unexpected side effect: Friendliness among the salesgirls in that little shop was no longer freely given.</p>

<p>With food and hiking boots and backpack ready, I waited for the morning of the trip to pack. It was going to start as an ordinary working day, after all. Once I began packing, my new backpack grew stuffed far too soon. After sitting on it to get the zip to work,  I looked around and saw I hadn&rsquo;t packed a back up pair of shoes. So I was going to go from bitter winter in the north to a warm autumn in the south, with nothing but the brand new and very warm fur lined winter hiking boots on my feet.</p>

<p>I decided I could live with warm feet, but not without the other stuff still lying around. Experience had taught me that those renting out cheap rooms often think a pillow good enough that I might not want in the same bed with me. To make sure I can sleep I bring own mini-pillow. And putting on a meditation shawl is a marvellous way to transform ‘sitting around with my eyes closed, obviously hoping someone will ask me to do something else’ into ‘meditating and not to be disturbed’. Both pillow and shawl were indispensable. And then there was all that food.

<p><article class="excerpt-words">
I grudgingly dug out a small and well travelled carry-on and began filling it up. With that unexpectedly overflowing I put on the backpack. It was a challenge to drape the carry-on’s strap over top of me and the bulk of the backpack. With the impossible accomplished, I stumbled out the door and started the long hike through campus to my office.</p>

<p>I was amazed to find all the staff gathered to officially present me with a gift. It was a massive traditional red knot to hang on Mom&rsquo;s wall, one that is said to bring good fortune.  I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out how it does this, but whatever it does, it looks wonderful. Maybe those intricate patterns folding back on themselves are enlivening something. I guess I should have asked&hellip;.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I wasn’t coming back before flying home, and I now had an enormous red cardboard box to pack  in my bags.  Before I could give in to panic, Ming arrived. The food disappeared into her bags and just enough space miraculously opened up for the knot. Oddly enough, her bags, even with all my food, were smaller than mine. Most people could learn something about travelling light from the Chinese.</p>

<p>It was a long trip to the airport, and with Ming and Xiǎo Wáng so close together, a remarkably silent one. Everyone was certainly being polite. We rushed to the airline’s counter, validated our tickets, then scrambled for the boarding area. Naturally we had to go through security, and as soon as we got there everyone from the office waved and left.</p>

<p>Security isn’t much of a trial compared the typical experience in the US, but they still managed to find a pocket knife I’d hidden away in my backpack. It was just large enough that they insisted on confiscating it. Unfortunately I had just bought the wretched thing to have something to open the packs of food I’d also just bought. I got mulish, and refused to be parted from it.</p>

<p>Ming glared at me like the spoilt child I was, grabbed the bag and headed back to the check-in counter. Twenty minutes later she showed up again, all silent and broody. At least I was happy, and after that last minor snafu certain nothing more could go wrong.
