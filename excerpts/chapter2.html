<h1>Click anywhere to close this </h1> <em>intro to a chapter from a book exploring esoteric China.</p>

<p>I devoted months to writing and researching the book, then abandoned it to Amazon and Fate. Unfortunately neither did my marketing for me.</p>

<p>My friends finally convinced me to put a little effort into promotion. This is my advertising campaign. Are you impressed yet?</p>

<p>Mindy claimed the story would only get read if I emphasize miracles. I didn&#8217;t believe her and simplified things. She may have been right, so this time I&#8217;ll cut loose and see if <strong>that</strong> sparks any interest.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll go through the book chapter by chapter, then reassemble the book from the updated parts. If you think some aspect of the book needs work, feel free to leave your suggestions in the comments section at the bottom of the page.</p></em>

<div class="excerpt-hidden" id="ex-hidden">
Mindy doesn&#8217;t give up easily. She kept finding things we could do together that made so much sense I couldn&#8217;t say no. Eventually she suggested we meet with her master, Little Buddha. I delayed as much as I could on ethical issues. On top of my habit of ignoring good advice, I refuse to  trust anyone who claims to know the deepest secrets of life. I&#8217;m even less inclined to consult them if they call themselves a &#8216;Master&#8217;, promoting themselves as a final authority.

Mindy insisted such a translation of Little Buddha&#8217;s status was wrong, at least as used by Chinese Buddhists. Furthermore, she explained, there was no implied commitment&mdash;I needn&#8217;t actually follow Little Buddha&#8217;s suggestions. Besides, she lived nearby, and the appointment was already made. So I was dragged, feebly protesting, into a taxi to meet Little Buddha. She had studied in Tibet and was said to be able to see deeply into anyone&#8217;s past. Even better, she had a reputation for helping people take charge of their own unique path to enlightenment.

We got out in the business district where Little Buddha lives, then cut through an unobtrusive gray alley carved out of the front of an otherwise impressive glass fronted shop. From there we ended up in a dead end courtyard jammed full of derelict looking sheds. Mindy led me up a flight of decrepit concrete stairs, across a balcony, and into a short hallway. The first door turned out to be Little Buddha&#8217;s tiny apartment, her bedroom window overlooking one of the busiest streets in the city.

We met in the quieter side of her suite, facing that dismal courtyard, the only view the gray concrete masses of eight story tall walk up apartments. There wasn&#8217;t a speck of green. It wasn&#8217;t pretty, but it sure was typical of modern China. A sensible person would have wondered how any trace of spirituality could survive that environment. I sat down to see what I could learn.

Mindy and I perched on tiny stools while Little Buddha sat on her daughter&#8217;s bed. I hoped they were discussing ways to speed up my progress. She and Mindy chattered away in Mandarin for ages, until Mindy reluctantly broke off for a sketchy translation. First she listed spiritual leaders I had been in the past. This part seems de rigueur among Buddhists, as if they are helpfully establishing your credentials.

They told me how important my past lives had been&mdash;I must have made a lot of bad choices in those lives to not yet be enlightened&mdash;and then they warned me not to tell anyone else. Name dropping is not a class act even when you actually know the people owning the names. Name dropping from some possible and long forgotten past seems about as foolish as you can get&mdash;I was happy to agree.

Then she began telling me where we should go. It turns out Chinese tradition demands visiting holy places to earn points towards enlightenment. Little Buddha knew more about my previous travels than I did. She figured if I visited three more holy spots I&#8217;d earn myself some kind of breakthrough.

It was already October, which is an ideal time to visit southern China, but not practical for getting leave from work. Left to myself, I might have thought about it a lot, but the trip would never have happened. However at that point my Mom finally admitted she was scheduled for surgery and would need someone to look after her. Mindy persuaded me our journey should be squeezed in before a trip home to help her during recovery.

Some people just never learn. But then, they don&#8217;t have adventures either. I figured I had acquired enough survival skills that I could handle Mindy. I was wrong, but not as wrong as before. And mistakes are how we learn.

In China, the great places of pilgrimage are mountains. There are five principle ones for Taoists, four for Buddhists, and an enormous host of less popular crags with smaller temples. They may not make the list of immortal temples, yet a few of those humbler places still draw half a million visitors a year to petition for celestial favors. Those pilgrims spend generously.

After my time in India I was shocked at how wealthy some Chinese temples can be. Some of the largest are state treasures, run by the government with hired monks working there as a day job. Weird.  Stranger still, many of the smaller, newly re-built temples, like the one I visited earlier, are for profit enterprises run by investors.

It was even more shocking to discover that, under the communist party&#8217;s guidance, monks had been persuaded to give up celibacy. The choice offered back in revolutionary days had been simple&mdash;encourage marriage or be banned. The followers of the Tao always married, but as China slips farther and farther from zealous communism, celibacy has been re-emerging among the ranks of increasingly devoted (but often overly intellectual) Buddhists.

What hasn&#8217;t changed is the curious requirement that &#8216;real&#8217; monks be trained at government approved universities. I had a hard time wrapping my head around a four year degree in monkishness&mdash;apparently there is so much ritual to learn that these years are considered vital. In other words, most monks have become priests, and true monks are no longer common.

The holiness of China&#8217;s sites may not be what it was, but most of China&#8217;s holiest mountains are a day&#8217;s travel from Shanghai. My first thought was to start from there. Shanghai would be a natural start for a trip home, and I&#8217;d never have to admit I was sneaking off early to do a little illicit tourism.

My plan was to head from Shanghai to a nearby island called Putuóshan, roughly translated as Rugged Mountain. A strange name for a place that is a mere bump in the ocean, but pilgrimage spots must be called mountains. Turns out in China: “A mountain is famous not for its height, but for its holiness.” The whole island is sacred to Guanyin Púsà, the embodiment of compassion. (With the exception of some of the hotels, since their owners are among the most avaricious in China) Guanyin is the protector of women and children, the champion of the sick, the disabled, and the poor.

The idea was to visit her island, then loop up to Jiuhuáshan, or Nine Flowers Mountain. That set of peaks is considered the home of Dìzàng Púsà. He goes anywhere to help those in need. His qualities include unflagging optimism, fearlessness, and gentleness. Even better, he never abandons anyone who calls on him for help.

Not a bad trip, and one we could do at a leisurely pace so I could actually squeeze my meditations in. Right. It didn&#8217;t take Mindy long to get on her computer and began researching other travel options. I soon discovered we had two more spots to visit and we weren&#8217;t starting out in Shanghai.

Sandwiched in between our spiritual adventures would be a visit to the most famous tourist mountain in all of China, Huángshan, or Yellow Mountain. We&#8217;d also make a stop at the jewel of China&#8217;s literary past, West Lake, ancient home of the immortal White Snake. Through incomparable skill in the Tao, this delightful reptile had lived among the people as a great lady.

Mindy&#8217;s idea of an interesting trip, as you may have gathered, is to head out on the infamous hard seats of slow trains or on the only slightly more comfortable seats of long distance buses. If you&#8217;ve done this kind of travel you&#8217;ll know it palls quickly. It gets unbearable when you have a lot of luggage. Everything in one backpack became my goal.

In the weeks before I left I hunted for a pack that could double as a suitcase and had wheels. I&#8217;m still not sure why I wanted the extra weight and awkwardness of wheels, but it did reduce the number of choices. Eventually I found a gorgeous silver fibred beauty, with a special compartment underneath for shoes and all kinds of compartments inside, including one for a laptop. They only wanted $70 for this incredible thing. It had my name all over it.

After much discussion, everyone helping me agreed. It was much too expensive. And I wasn&#8217;t going to carry a heavy computer anyway. They insisted we keep looking until they found one costing a third of that. With everyone now fully approving, I was urged to ignore how small it was and how much space was taken up by the frame. We also ignored the hard plastic base that would bite into my back during a long days trek. Everyone ignored the bright red color and the funny handle that stuck out the top like an antenna. They knew I wasn&#8217;t trying to look cool. They were all so enthused it was easier just to buy the dratted thing.

Things were quickly getting organized, far too organized, yet I still hadn&#8217;t cleared the trip with my boss. I finally got around to sending an off-hand message to her assistant&mdash;my excuse was that he had much better English and I didn&#8217;t want to challenge my boss&#8217;s understanding. Within an hour she was at my desk demanding an explanation for my not asking directly. She quickly agreed to my taking time off work to help my Mom, but I was still too embarrassed to mention that I was slipping off early to visit temples.

Then a week before we were due to leave I learned my boss had arranged a car and a good number of people from the office would be going to the airport to see me off. Nice gesture, but it would be incredibly obvious that I wasn&#8217;t flying straight back home. How was I going to explain flying to an insignificant city (a mere million people) that was in the middle of nowhere? The only reason to go was that it happened to be the closest airport to the first mountain I was going to visit.

As if that wasn&#8217;t bad enough, I was traveling with Mindy. And while Mindy likes to help people, and while doing so can be kindness personified, in emergencies she transforms into a human bulldozer, completely devoid of tact. You&#8217;ll remember the disaster of our first trip? I&#8217;d better back up and give a little more detail.

Mindy had ended up returning on the same train, but with a standing ticket. She was off in another coach, heading to visit her cousin. Her daughter had gone to visit that cousin a few days earlier, but would miss school unless she traveled back that night. I suspect her cousin was also told to get that ticket a little too late, so only another standing ticket was available.

Long past the last possible minute to arrange things, Mindy let me know I was nominated as chaperone for a child who would otherwise be standing by herself in the aisles. Which you will probably agree is not something you ask a nine year old to do on an overnight train.

Mindy sent a text to her daughter, ordering her to run up to me on the platform and display such extravagant affection that everyone would assume I was her long lost father. Then she sent a text to my boss&#8217;s niece, Xiao Wáng, who I&#8217;d had the good luck to meet in the waiting room before boarding. I know, the odds for that happening are awfully small, but this is how my life works. She had been visiting her husbands family, and they live an hour the other way from the temple.

We were approaching Mindy&#8217;s stop when Xiao Wáng read the text. I have never seen Xiao Wáng more furious. After hurling her cell phone across the carriage and cursing with abandon, she somehow cooled off enough to insist on standing outside with me to collect Mindy&#8217;s daughter. Then, when the conductor followed rules and wouldn&#8217;t let a little girl with no real ticket in our car, Xiao Wáng joined me jammed in the aisles of a hard seat car with hordes of impoverished seatless passengers, patiently lobbying the hapless conductor while the nine year old silently pleaded with huge sad eyes.

Every time I tried to say something comforting, the little waif would turn back and impatiently hush me. The two of them worked over that poor conductor in ways I could never imagine. After half an hour of this the conductor got her boss to allow a few broken rules. Mindy&#8217;s daughter got to stay with us, but Xiao Wáng never forgave Mindy. Being a &#8216;bad mother&#8217; is one of the ultimate sins in China. And guess who was organizing the office car?

Knowing they would think I was crazy, I decided it was time to admit to my boss I was sneaking away early for a temple tour. I found myself explaining that I planned to get Guanyin Púsà&#8217;s blessings for my Mother. She was getting a second hip operation, you see, after her first implant had broken up. Nobody wanted the operation to go wrong. While the thought of getting some blessings for her had been there, it wasn&#8217;t one I wanted to admit to. When I did, to my surprise the tradition of respect for parents overcame modern insistence on practicality.

Having survived that awkward moment, I had to explain to Xiao Wáng about Mindy; she was there because I needed a real Buddhist along with me. Well, to be honest, I needed someone who spoke Chinese. I barely spoke enough to buy food at street stalls, where you can point at what you want. And solo travel is not simple in China. This was obvious to everyone: no Mindy, no China tour.  Xiao Wáng&#8217;s glower made it clear she still thought I was nuts for choosing Ming of all people, but at least she didn&#8217;t scold me. Instead she spent the afternoon quietly sniffing whenever she saw me. There was no enthusiasm from anyone else in the office either, leaving me wondering if they&#8217;d given up on me.

At this point I remembered I needed food for the trip. The Chinese seem intent on eating as much pork, fish, and chicken as humanly possible at every meal. Vegetarianism is an even stranger food choice there than it is here. The only vegetarian food store I knew near me was a little shop across the street from the local Buddhist temple. No one there spoke English and my Mandarin didn&#8217;t let me ask any questions about what they sold. Fortunately most of their stuff was from Hong Kong so the labels were English. Better yet, the shop girls were all friendly. Saying zhège (this one) and pointing worked like a charm. I soon had a basketful of bland tofu based emergency rations.

Unfortunately I was running late and had to rush out of the store to get home. Twenty feet from the door a stranger approached me — as in India, beggars love temples, and can be counted on to lie  in wait, ready to try any trick for a little cash. Especially from a westerner, a person so obviously rich. Whoever he was, he tried to stop me, but when I ignored him he hustled off.

I was relieved, assuming he&#8217;d given up, but as soon as I rounded the corner, he was in my face again, walking backwards so he could talk to me while trying to push something into my arms. I was wary of the old trick of &#8216;giving&#8217; you something and then demanding payment. I tried to sidle around him while holding a hand up to ward him off. He kept trying to give me whatever it was. I kept saying méiyou, thinking I was telling him I didn&#8217;t want it. Unfortunately it turns out to mean “don&#8217;t have”, which was unlikely to dissuade anyone. Some time later a sulking Qing to accidentally teach me a more effective way to convey disinterest: Ten minutes of her chanting búyào seared that phrase into my even my feeble memory.

At any rate, when the pursuing local saw I wasn&#8217;t responding, he had a brilliant idea. He pulled open my jacket, pushed the thing inside, then let go. Unfortunately, gravity is just as effective outside a temple as elsewhere. The object unexpectedly slipped through my coat to the ground and landed with a sickening crunch. I looked down and saw that between us we&#8217;d just shattered a large ceramic statue. One of Guanyin Púsà, the same being who&#8217;s island I was planning to visit.

I don&#8217;t know what the sensible thing is when you&#8217;ve just done something that stupid, but I figured I knew who to ask. I called Ming and told her to check with Little Buddha. After being thoroughly scolded for my failed attempt to speak Mandarin, she finally agreed to talk to Little Buddha. Who for all her saintliness just happened to work as a cook at that temple.

On her instructions, I ended up buying a replacement statue for the local monks and paying for the monks to do a ceremony to appease Guanyin Púsà. After that everything was supposed to be fine. I wasn&#8217;t convinced, especially since the process cost me much more than the original statue would have. And the guy apparently was just trying to give me a gift. This was both a lousy omen and an even worse reflection on my openness to adventure. And it had another unexpected side effect: There was no longer friendliness from the salesgirls in that little shop.

With food and hiking boots and backpack ready, I waited for the morning of the trip to pack. It was going to start as an ordinary working day, after all. Once I began packing, my new backpack grew stuffed far too soon. After sitting on it to get the zip to work,  I looked around and saw I hadn&#8217;t packed a back up pair of shoes. So I was going to go from bitter winter in the north to a warm autumn in the south, with nothing but the brand new and very warm fur lined winter hiking boots on my feet.

I decided I could live with warm feet, but not without the other stuff still lying around. Experience had taught me that those renting out cheap rooms often think a pillow good enough that I might not want in the same bed with me. To make sure I can sleep I bring own mini-pillow. And putting on a meditation shawl is a marvellous way to transform &#8216;sitting around with my eyes closed, obviously hoping someone will ask me to do something else&#8217; into &#8216;meditating and not to be disturbed&#8217;. Both pillow and shawl were indispensable. And then there was all that food.

I grudgingly dug out a small and well travelled carry-on and began filling it up. With that unexpectedly overflowing I put on the backpack. It was a challenge to drape the carry-on&#8217;s strap over top of me and the bulk of the backpack. With the impossible accomplished, I stumbled out the door and started the long hike through campus to my office.

I was amazed to find all the staff gathered to officially present me with a gift. It was a massive traditional red knot to hang on Mom&#8217;s wall, one that is said to bring good fortune.  I&#8217;m still trying to figure out how it does this, but whatever it does, it looks wonderful. Maybe those intricate patterns folding back on themselves are enlivening something. I guess I should have asked&#8230;.

Unfortunately I wasn&#8217;t coming back before flying home, and I now had an enormous red cardboard box to pack  in my bags.  Before I could give in to panic, Ming arrived. The food disappeared into her bags and just enough space miraculously opened up for the knot. Oddly enough, her bags, even with all my food, were smaller than mine. Most people could learn something about travelling light from the Chinese.

It was a long trip to the airport, and with Ming and Xiao Wáng so close together, a remarkably silent one. Everyone was certainly being polite. We rushed to the airline&#8217;s counter, validated our tickets, then scrambled for the boarding area. Naturally we had to go through security, and as soon as we got there everyone from the office waved and left.

Security isn&#8217;t much of a trial compared the typical experience in the US, but they still managed to find a pocket knife I&#8217;d hidden away in my backpack. It was brand new, I&#8217;d just bought it for the trip, and it was large enough that they insisted on confiscating it. Unfortunately I planned on usingthe wretched thing to open the packs of food I&#8217;d just bought. I got mulish, and refused to be parted from it.

Ming glared at me like the spoilt child I was, grabbed the bag and headed back to the check-in counter. Twenty minutes later she showed up again, looking all silent and broody. At least I was happy, and after that last minor snafu certain nothing more could go wrong.</div>
