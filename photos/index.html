    This is a quiet spot just off a trail in China&#8217;s Hu&aacute;ngsh&#257;n or Yellow Mountain park. We hiked there near the end of a long drought when streams had shrunk to mere trickles and high thin clouds tantalized with promises of a rain that refused to come.<br>
    
    While enjoying the silence in that corner of the huge park, it was hard to believe that thousands were tramping their way up more popular trails. The most famous peak&#8217;s viewpoints are usually crammed with hundreds of tourists sitting on the ground, raptly listening to guides explaining the history of strange looking rocks and other objects that feature in the legends of China.<br>
    
    There are so many beautiful places tucked into this area that a lot of Chinese films are shot here. Pivitol scenes from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon were filmed just around the corner from Mindy&#8217;s impromtu seat&mdash;which happens to be on the edge of a cliff.

    Here nature has been carefully managed for generations. This pond has been walled in and is perfectly clear, unlike the usual dirt banks and muddy state nature would provide. Stone steps wind around the massive rocks. This detailed work on paths is typical of the more popular Chinese parks. Even mid range parks are getting their paths rebuilt.<br>
    
    Mindy insisted we climb up on a boulder to pose for the camera. They really look like a family of stone hippopotamuses, and clambering up for a photo-op is so popular that one monster is complete with a heavy chain as a climbing aid. I don&#8217;t know how Chinese tourists lived before digital cameras&mdash;they spend most of their trips finding things to pose on or in front of. Sometimes, like Mindy in the previous shot, the places they choose are incredibly dangerous.<br>

    <p class="photo-words">
    Mindy practised kungfu from childhood and this gives her an almost terrifying approach to hiking. She invariably heads up whatever slope the mountain throws out at a trot. When I suggested she match my exhausted plod, she tried for a moment, then told me she couldn&#8217;t go that slow.<br>
    
    This shot is perhaps 1/3 of the way up the main trail, still early in the day. To finish the hike before dark, you have to start early. Very early. Just past the stone wall is a rest area complete with stalls selling water, cucumbers, and trinkets. Yes, raw cucumber is a popular Chinese snack.<br>
    
    The walls ahead may have started life as part of an ancient Taoist site&mdash;their schools once dotted the mountain. Yellow Mountain originally gained fame as the place where the Yellow Emperor learned the Tao. He was the legendary ruler who first united China maybe seven thousand years ago.

    <p class="photo-words">
    Hundreds of tourists listen patiently as guides with small portable speakers lecture them. Note the hats&mdash;each color belongs to a different tour group, but the guides have no way to separate out theirs from the general mob. The guides simply stand at gathering places waving their little flag and orating to who ever is there, and things work out in the end.<br>
    
    This viewpoint is good for the oddly shaped boulders (gu&agrave;i sh&iacute;, or uncanny rocks) that decorate the mountain, as if dropped on the peaks by a careless god. They have fanciful names, like &#8216;frog watching the sky&#8217; or &#8216;flying stone&#8217;. If you look closely, most times you&#8217;ll immediately understand the reason for the name.

    <p class="photo-words">
    Another spectacular view. Off in the distance a wave of cloud curls over the top of a peak. Half an hour later it made it to our mountain top, disturbing our picnic. We decided to flee while we could still see the trail.<br>
    
    The trip down starts in a narrow cleft and descends precipitously. Mindy&#8217;s toe managed to work its way through her sock and we had to pause briefly while she sewed the hole up. We were quickly joined by throngs of curious children. It was amazing how young and energetic some were, in spite of having hiked for hours.

    <p class="photo-words">
    This picture of the trip down from the peak gives a sense of how many people walk the trails. At this point the steepest descent is done and hikers begin heading up to the next peak, to take pictures in front of &#8220;Welcoming Guest Pine.&#8221; Note towards the bottom there are a couple of sedan chairs waiting for rich and exhausted tourists to ask for help. Up in the mountains, they are the only hope when legs give out after enduring thousands of stairs that wear out knees and cramp muscles.<br>
    
   The fog that swept over the peak earlier was already breaking up, but it remained a wonderful and mysterious landscape.
