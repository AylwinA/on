<div class="entry-content"><p>Last year I created a new site, and it was good. Yet no one read it, so I approached the great Google and requested that it add its magic of analytics to my site. Google graciously did so, and that too was good.</p>

<p>Then I began reading the results on Google&rsquo;s website, and they were not good. Behold, there were many visits, but they were all by me. Displeased, I returned to Google and requested that the data be more pure, so I could know the truth, even if it were bitter.</p>

<p>Google&rsquo;s site wizards suggested that if I screened out my own URL the data would be better. As soon as I set up a filter Google insisted on warning me that my data might no longer be valid. I became worried and returned, hoping to verify that Google&rsquo;s first suggestion was correct. After carefully checking everything it became clear that Google believed I was too stupid to understand that I was excluding my own visits from my data.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise when I discovered, after all this fuss, that none of my past visits had been filtered out of the data. Perhaps the purity of raw data is so important to Google that a little thing like my desire to only see others visiting my site is not important. Perhaps it is careful programming, saving a few millionths of a second of processing time by throwing data out on input, but not actually filtering existing data. Surely this irritating result is not how the great Google operates?</p>

<p>From there it became even more interesting. Apparently Google&rsquo;s long tailed search engine (the one that finds answers to peculiarly detailed requests that few care about) managed to find me visitors from the mysterious heartland of Russia. I was very happy, especially as there were several of them, and they returned again and again. After a few days I noticed those from Moscow never actually stopped to read my pages. I became curious and decided to visit their referring links. There were several of them. Imagine my surprise when I found they all led to the same place. Even more interesting, the same URLs on different days led to different places.</p>

<p>How could this be happening, you ask? This is part of the mystery of the analytics of Google. It looks suspiciously like they inadvertently found me a place in some sort of click-farm. You know, like they have for places like Facebook, where in order to fool the algorithm that stands guard over the riches paid by advertisers, clever bots click on paying and random unpaid pages. This fools weak algorithms and increases the wealth of clever programmers.</p>

<p>Surely no one has so thoroughly fooled the clever analytics of Google&mdash;unless the programmers at Google figure this is an edge case. But if this is an edge case that works, you can be sure there will be a lot more promotion of sites by these kinds of fake links. On one day the links all pointed to a site by Aliexpress, which is Alibaba&rsquo;s cross between Amazon and Ebay. It has a huge presence in Russia, and I&rsquo;m beginning to suspect how it quickly built up such a dominant position&hellip;.</p>
