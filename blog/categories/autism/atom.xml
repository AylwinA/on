    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fewer and fewer people believe they know how to make friends. We have all kinds of bigger things to worry about, yet this small failing can easily make life miserable. The modern solution is to plead being some flavor of &lsquo;autistic&rsquo;, as if this is an all purpose excuse for social incompetence. Unfortunately it isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>In our culture of strangers, where we may never talk to our own neighbours, poor social skills are a real problem. Unless we find some &lsquo;safe&rsquo; time to learn how to talk to strangers, we&rsquo;ll never make friends, never form new relationships. We&rsquo;ll just be another lost soul, hurrying through life with eyes downcast, unaware of all the fascinating and irritating life around us. Some skill at interacting with those who do fall into our orbit is essential to enjoying life.</p>

<p>The challenges of enjoying other people&rsquo;s company can be thought of in two parts. First we want a way to render the disgruntled people life forces us to interact with on a daily basis more amiable. Second, we need to find better ways to meet those who are, for some odd reason, predisposed to enjoy being around us.</p>

<p>So what is it that we need to change? For now, I&rsquo;ll stick to the first challenge, getting twits to be more accommodating. My favourite instruction is to &ldquo;think good thoughts&rdquo; about the people we deal with. Some people make that particularly hard to do, but with a little luck our positive influence helps them to start thinking better of us&mdash;even while they continue behaving like jerks. Remember, you aren&rsquo;t going to change their nature, just the degree of animosity you have to endure from them.</p>

<p>The heart of the skill is finding something&mdash;anything about them we can sympathize with. This may take research. They can&rsquo;t be a failure in <em>every</em> aspect of their lives. (In case that doesn&rsquo;t turn out to be true, I can only suggest you flee their influence as far and fast as humanly possible)</p>

<p>A corollary of that instruction is to avoid giving into the temptation to bad-mouth blockheads. Yes, they deserve it, and it does make you feel better. Well, at least temporarily. The problem is that louts <strong>will</strong> hear about your complaints. Usually presented to them in the worst possible light. Keeping your mouth shut with a little luck will fool evil ones into suspecting you are a better person than you really are. Isn&rsquo;t it better to have trolls confused by you rather than becoming all angry and vicious the moment they see you?</p>

<p>We both know that thinking well of others, even when they act foolishly, is not an easy or quick solution. And we by nature prefer easy short term solutions. So we just have to try it out, seeing if it will work for us. Since by nature we resist change, some effort will be involved. The root of resistance to change is the delusion that our opinions are inviolable, that they define who we are. But Confucius told it straight:</p>

<blockquote><p>They must often change opinions who would be constant in happiness or wisdom.</p></blockquote>
