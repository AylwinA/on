<div class="entry-content"><h2>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Inflation</h2>

<p>Back in the great depression, bankers were reviled. They either failed to preserve corporate assets and went bankrupt, thereby increasing the misery of the poor, or grimly held on to too much, thus increasing the misery of the poor. But bankers were reviled for their hold on money generations before that. They are sure to be seen as enemies of the poor for generations to come. Only the reasons change.</p>

<p>The first banks emerged from under the shadow of Church sponsored usury laws. People always need loans, and unscrupulous people with money to spare are always willing to lend, at least for a price. Back when lending for interest was illegal, lenders had few tools to get their money back when a deal soured. That led to a close connection between banks and criminal enforcers, one that endures, at least in public imagination. Jews were among the few not religiously forbidden to lend, starting the long tradition of Europe&rsquo;s Shylocks. For centuries Europeans distrusted their supposed hidden hand behind worldly affairs.</p>

<blockquote><p> &ldquo;Jewish usurers bleed the poor to death and grow fat on their substance, shall I see them robbed of what belongs to them and keep silent?&rdquo;<br> &mdash;Bernardin of Feltre, circa 1450 AD</p></blockquote>

<p>Once banking turned legal, control gradually became more widespread. Most bankers still worked for the family owning the money, earning little more than other clerks. Today the bonuses of top deal makers are stunning, making bankers the highest paid people in America.</p>

<p>For the last few decades there has been a growing disconnect between incomes of wage earners and the elite. Almost every society ends up this way, but America prides itself on its democratic leveling of society. The present reality of bankers as ultra rich hedge fund managers is bitter.</p>

<p>Because democracy depends on votes and it takes money (and a message, and a party affiliation) to persuade people to elect anyone, it is widely assumed that the average politician has been bought. No one can say exactly who has done the buying, but the wealth given lawmakers by bankers while lawmakers managed the financial crisis definitely puts them among the likely suspects. Curiously, what would be seen as a bribe elsewhere, in America is a legitimate political donation.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>What builds wealth in America has changed from colonial times. Back then, aside from those annoying Yankee traders, society believed real wealth was based on landholding. Then the Industrial Revolution transformed America and the sources of wealth. J. P. Morgan and other banks profited greatly from the transition. Morgan alone ended up either owning or being a directors of almost 85% of the companies on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>He wasn&rsquo;t alone. Other banks were active and were seriously unloved. It was a time of rampant stock market manipulation and of openly corrupt politicians. In that environment, bankers were the fix-it men, filling an immensely profitable role. Bankers owned their banks, so they had no need for astronomical salaries. They earned big, but they risked big, and sometimes lost it all.</p>

<p>Not so the modern banker. Goldman Sachs is a shareholder owned corporation where management has chosen to raid assets in good times and bad. They helped invent and took a dominant position in derivatives trading. Some of these derivatives are what Warren Buffet called &ldquo;financial weapons of mass destruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even after the fiasco of 2008, the Bank of International Settlements pegged yearly trades of derivatives as worth $17.4 trillion dollars. The Economist estimates their total value at closer to $700 trillion. For comparison, the US GDP is around $17 trillion, and the Federal Budget may end up being around $3.7 trillion. There obviously isn&rsquo;t enough money in the world to bail the banks out, yet any bank failing could destroy financial markets and end world trade.</p>

<p>Individual bankers, early on in the derivative trade, realized they didn&rsquo;t need to wait to for their bonus until the derivative being sold had matured. Heck, if they did that, they might have to wait decades for mortgages to be fully paid off. So they started giving themselves bonuses when a purchaser signed the contract.</p>

<p>They believed they&rsquo;d successfully pushed the risk to the sucker&mdash;I mean client, so taking the money and running seemed perfectly reasonable. Way back in 2008, when the fancy algorithms they&rsquo;d been using turned out to have been misused and their structured mortgages collapsed, no banker offered to return bonuses. They felt the quants who wrote the fancy software had lied to them, and <em>they</em> should suffer.</p>

<p>Once traders began questioning the value of these sliced up mortgages, valuation became impossible. Lehman Brothers saw their core holdings, in supposedly AAA assets, suddenly implode. The government ignored the problem, letting Lehman Brothers collapse. Since Lehman was counter-party to a huge number of other derivative trades, the whole edifice of international commerce threatened to collapse. This was how the government suddenly and shockingly discovered that banks could be &lsquo;too big to fail&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Almost overnight the remaining banks were bailed out and the rules they operate under changed to hide the damage to their balance sheets. Other banks were bullied into picking up distressed assets without a clear idea of what they were worth. The regulators rushed in, ignoring fault and just managing to restore order. Inevitably bad banks were paid off and villains left unpunished. This left the remaining banks even weaker, so the government started throwing money at them.</p>

<p>Now that the brink of disaster is a faint memory from half a dozen years ago, the government wants to recover points lost in public opinion polls. They are running a continuing series of costly court cases designed to make us feel the evil beast was being held accountable. Billions have been taken from the shareholders of the banks, often for deals the government forced them to make. As yet, no banker has returned their bonuses.</p>

<p>The bailout involved the government taking on the banks weakest assets, the paper held on broken mortgages. This was dangerous, unless somehow it could be arranged that housing prices didn&rsquo;t go down. Since this is one of the usual events in a recession, steps had to be taken. The first choice was to stimulate the economy with low low interest rates. Just ten years earlier, when the Asian economies imploded, western authorities banned this solution, believing it led to investors chasing high risk investments, or just borrowing to take the money offshore where it would earn more interest.</p>

<p>If it would have been a mistake in Asia, was it wise in America? It did allow more people to afford houses, but not enough, especially since the banks behaved exactly as the World Bank had predicted, and money failed to enter the local economy. The Quantitative Easing program was needed to buy the last of the problem mortgages, throwing extra cash into the system. It still didn&rsquo;t stimulate the economy, instead leading to a little more inflation in commodity prices. Now that Quantitative Easing is easing off, those prices are moving the other way.</p>

<p>Inflation is the only tool left to let government pay its debts. Unfortunately inflation destroys the value of wages. We now have a government worse than that suffered by the colonies. It may more closely resemble conditions at the end of the Revolutionary War, when America was awash with unpayable debt. The methods chosen to deal with it destroyed the wealth of American patriots while rewarding the country&rsquo;s two-timing bankers. It will be unfortunate if history repeats itself.</p>

<p>Perhaps instead we&rsquo;ll have another, greener revolution. After passing through a few years of trauma the collapse of what we have now will lead to a simpler, wiser, more spiritual and yes, more egalitarian way of life. It seems unlikely, but so did the fall of the Berlin wall.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are to be ruined now by a deluge of bank paper&hellip;<br>
It is cruel that such revolutions in private fortunes should be at the mercy of avaricious adventurers, who, instead of employing their capital, if any they have, in manufactures, commerce, or other useful pursuits, make it an instrument to burden all the interchanges of property with their swindling profits, profits which are the price of no useful industry of theirs.&rdquo;<br> &mdash;Thomas Jefferson</p></blockquote>
