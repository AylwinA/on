<div class="entry-content"><p>We create each present moment by our past actions. The grip of this present moment is very difficult to escape, but most of the time no one cares. We are so busy planning for the future that a little discomfort now is nothing. Most see no reason to seek a different destiny until plans unravel as inimical fate takes over. Only then do we decide it is time to change. Unfortunately it takes greater wisdom than most have to figure out how to change for the better.</p>

<p>In the Vedic tradition of India, we are said to be trapped in the muddy fields of mundane existence. In case that makes no sense, I&rsquo;ll expand the analogy. I don&rsquo;t know if you have ever slogged across a sodden field, each step growing more difficult as a heavy mass of clay rich soil builds up on the bottom of your boots. If you stop to rest, the mud congeals together, locking your feet immobile to the ground. Imagine it is dark, with no obvious route to escape the mud. The unfortunate tendency is to wander around in circles, growing more and more tired until collapse is inevitable.</p>

<p>This is how the sages see the endless desires and attachments of the unenlightened&mdash;weights dragging them down from life to life&mdash;layers of attachment that make it painfully difficult to get past ignorance to enlightenment. Religions are <em>supposed</em> to be giving us that guidance, but for far too long they have failed their followers.</p>

<p>The problem is that each religion, which began by reviving the vision of spirit as a necessity for a fully meaningful life, became stuck filtering explanations of its traditions through a few representatives. Since people with intensely spiritual natures are usually extremely impractical, it ends up being non-spiritual managers who decide matters of doctrine. Because those choosing what points to teach are from among those most caught up in activity, it only takes a generation to lose the path of knowledge.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Our western tradition has had two thousand years to become confused. There are bits and pieces of true knowledge among the gloss of vain ceremony and foolish words, but the average follower has no hope of separating the 1% that is useful from a host of traditions deeply lost in ignorance. Our religions celebrate various material aspects of life but neither understand nor encourage true spirituality. The leaders of each sect encourages their followers to convert others to their faith. Yet what purpose can be served by enacting fantasies of conversion? How can God, a transcendent being, beyond space, beyond our limited field of reasoning, unbounded by the limits of our languages, how can such a being care what name we use to call out for favors?</p>

<p>In the traditions of ancient India, they emphasized that the means to achieve desires gathered around those who were most pure. This completely contradicts the nature of modern life. Today only dishonest politicians achieve high office. The most prosperous businesses deceive their customers, either through clever advertising or by hiding endless misdeeds. How can we reconcile the needs of a spiritual life with the reality of an age where even the teachers of spirituality spread perversions of knowledge?</p>

<p>These are all symptoms of the loss of knowledge. No entrepreneur understanding the value of life would behave as our current CEOs feel they must. No real spiritual leader would spend time and energy weakening the flock of another. Reviving true spiritual knowledge is the only way forward that does not finish with us destroying our limited world for the sake of money.</p>

<p>Finding a way out is the greatest possible challenge of the intellect. To search endlessly until what looks like a path to a more spiritual life is stumbled on, and then to follow it, not with slavish devotion, but with an alert intellect, to see if the goal is coming closer.</p>

<p>One clue that the teaching is poor is a requirement that students abandon all doubts as a matter of faith. True faith is not a seizing up of logic, a grasping of traditions that have not produced true results for a millennium or more.  True faith arises gradually from experience, not suddenly by fiat. True faith requires a depth of understanding that can only come from questioning the nature of spirit and its value in life&mdash;and then finding satisfying answers.</p>

<p>I hope the new year opens the doors of experience to more minds tired of enduring an unsatisfactory life. May this year be the one your spirit blooms in joy, in love, in the true essence of God&rsquo;s grace.</p>
