<div class="entry-content"><p>Most people noticed the recent collapse of oil prices. I watched it in excruciating detail, as I am heavily invested in oil stocks that last month were worth many times what they are today. I held onto them with grim determination throughout their rapid descent, as logic insisted that the price of oil could not fall this far.</p>

<p>I made one of the classic errors of investors. Belief that logic will win out is the enemy of wealth. The market follows emotion, and emotions can be tricked into wanting things injurious to life.</p>

<p>If I am to make that money back, I have to figure out what emotions investors will be feeling over the next few months. Knowing that, I can guess where the market is going and place better bets. I&rsquo;m going to speculate here, hoping to stumble into a useful answer.</p>

<p>The first thing to look at is the irrational beliefs that dominate the market. One of the most irrational is the belief that production of oil has no limits. That is right folks, there is a fixed amount of oil in the ground, and once it is gone, we are done.</p>

<p>Actually, it is worse than that. Oil lurks in &lsquo;traps&rsquo;, unless it is heavy oil lying around waiting to leach into the environment. Tight oil, or shale oil, the stuff that has to be fracked, is stuck even more, in stone that is barely porous and hard to get out of. That is why drillers have to shatter the trap under extraordinary pressure, then jam proppants into the cracks to keep them open.</p>

<p>Fracking is weird stuff, using millions of gallons of water along with mystery chemicals that dissolve difficult rocks, or prevent stubborn bacteria or chemical deposits gumming things up, or just prevent the tiny proppants from falling out of solution. The most fascinating additive is radioactive tracer isotopes used to determine the location of fractures.</p>

<p>People are horrified when they discover what is being done&mdash;but as usual most miss the real problem. After all that liquid has been injected, the drillers have to get as much as they can back out again before they can get at the oil. At this point the driller has maybe &frac34; of a million gallons of extremely polluted water to dispose of.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, it isn&rsquo;t drilling that causes problems. It is drillers disposing of this toxic waste water into streams or shallow wells that then circulate into drinking water. When they act sensibly and use dedicated deep wells they can inadvertently lubricate seismic faults and induce small earthquakes. Is it any wonder that citizens are starting to get concerned about having frackers in their neighbourhood?</p>

<p>Fracked wells are also extremely costly. A single well can cost $8 million dollars. The end result (hopefully, given that geologists sometimes guess wrong&hellip;.) is a well that puts out a tremendous amount of oil. At first, anyway. Remember, this is tight oil. Oil begins to ooze out of fractured rock, but not all the rock is fractured. The fractures may be propped open by sand and have guar gum as a gelling agent to hold the sand in place (otherwise used as an indigestible food additive) but whatever they inject, over a few months the mother rock settles around the proppant.</p>

<p>Within a year, maybe half of the oil that is going to ooze has made its way to the surface. Each month the well produces fewer and fewer barrels a day&mdash;by the time it gets to a trickle &frac34; of the oil may still be locked in the rock. You can throw more and more money at the well to get the remains out, but the return on that investment grows less and less. With $40 oil, the well is more likely to be abandoned than stimulated.</p>

<p>This is the source of America&rsquo;s vaunted oil independence. First, its a kind of driller&rsquo;s Ponzi game, where more and more wells have to be drilled just to maintain production, yet the quality of the targets grows less and less. It should be an obvious problem, as no one intentionally drills the least likely site first.</p>

<p>Another challenge is that, oddly enough, fracking is the province of smaller drillers. Big oil stays away. Some of these guys are prudent with their money. Most aren&rsquo;t. The problem is that small drillers hoping to grow take out loans they can barely repay at higher prices. They bet the company on the price of oil going up, not covering their costs by selling next year&rsquo;s oil today. At current prices, many will be broke within a year. Believe me, I&rsquo;m not happy.</p>

<p>Finally, even with drills running day and night, Americans conveniently forget they import 40% of the oil they use. If the price of oil stays down, American oil production could decline by half within two years. That means America will be importing 70% of its oil while saving a ton of money at the pumps. The cost of that oil will be little more than what was paid for less imported oil last year. This won&rsquo;t be all bad, so an investor should try to make money by figuring out long term winners and losers. Right?</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But this long run is a misleading guide&hellip;. In the long run we are all dead.&rdquo;<br>&mdash;Keynes</p></blockquote>

<p>That seems to capture the investors dilemma. We remember yesterday and imagine tomorrow, but anything beyond that is uncertain. Experienced investors accept they have no clear picture of the future. To balance this, they act as if today is all that matters. When times are good, animal spirits drive markets far beyond their real value. When everyone feels gloomy, prices fall swiftly to irrational lows. The challenge for an astute investor is determining just how irrationally high or low prices will go.</p>

<p>Following the economic meltdown of 2008, the oil price collapsed to around $30 a barrel. With six years of inflation and increased production costs, $40 is the most absurd low anyone can now consider. Can it happen? Logically, no. It would destroy too many companies in the oil industry, taking their investors and banks with them. This disaster would take perhaps a decade to recover from.</p>

<p>In those ten years, the Saudis would (gasp!) be running out of oil. Russia would have been forced into partnership with China to develop their declining fields, and that oil would be contracted to China. America and Europe would be left out. Most American tight oil would have declined to stripper mode, yielding a few barrels a day. North Sea oil would be crippled, the the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska would both be on their last legs while Canada&rsquo;s oil sands would be struggling to survive.</p>

<p>This would be a triumph for environmentalists, would allow the Saudis to rejoice in crushing Iran, and would let the USA feel they had punished Russia. The real loser, of course, would be anyone wanting to preserve their standard of living. All those bankruptcies in the oil industry would have devastating knock-on effects. The risk is that now the decline in prices has started, external events will ensure it continues down to $40 a barrel.</p>

<p>If this happens, the main cause will be the extraordinary levels of debt dragging down every economy. Addiction to so-called Keynesian economics (more honestly known as buying votes) has led most countries in the world to spend their way out of recession. They have spent so much that they have used up the money needed to support small businesses, the real engines of growth. When the next recession takes hold, most countries will find themselves in a hole without the resources to dig themselves out.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is an extraordinary example of how, starting with a mistake, a remorseless logician can end up in bedlam.<br>&mdash;Keynes</p></blockquote>

<p>The odd thing is that no one can say exactly how and why this decline started. Circumstantial evidence suggests the American government colluded with the Saudi government to trigger the first fire sale, knowing the market would turn it into a rout. With ISIS selling stolen oil to finance their activity, cutting the price they get must have seemed desirable. However, no authority is publicly admitting collusion. The Saudi&rsquo;s publicly say they are doing it to shut down American tight oil. The USA wants us to believe the world is awash in their mite of new oil, and this is a natural market response.</p>

<p>Others point out that the futures markets drive oil prices. Futures trade almost ten times the actual volume of oil used every day as contracts for delayed delivery. These largely imaginary deals are supposed to help reveal what the future price of oil will be, and thus preserve capital in the markets. What they do instead is give the trading desks of banks an opportunity to profit from inside information, for hedge funds to put billions into artificially moving markets, and for the little guys, yet another place to gamble on what the market &lsquo;should&rsquo; do, and so lose money.</p>

<p>After carefully considering, the only conclusion I can come to (except that a slow motion disaster is unfolding before us) is that once again, Keynes was right:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is generally agreed that casinos should, in the public interest, be inaccessible and expensive. And perhaps the same is true of Stock Exchanges.</p></blockquote>

<p>But maybe there is one sensible investment hidden in this mess. I should start a sanatorium treating problem gamblers. Just think how much money I could make!</p>
