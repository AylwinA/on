<div class="entry-content"><p>Most people noticed the recent collapse of oil prices. I followed it in excruciating detail, as I invested heavily in oil stocks that started out worth many times what they are today. I held onto them with grim determination throughout their rapid descent, as logic insisted that the price of oil could not fall this far.</p>

<p>I made one of the classic errors of investors. Belief that logic will win out is the enemy of speculation. The market follows emotion, and emotions can be tricked into wanting things injurious to life.</p>

<p>If I am to make that money back, I have to figure out what emotions investors will be feeling over the next few months. Knowing that, I can guess where the market is going and place better bets. I&rsquo;m going to do some thinking here, hoping to stumble into a useful answer.</p>

<p>The first thing to look at is the irrational beliefs that dominate the market. One of the most wide spread is the belief that production of oil has no limits. Unfortunately folks, there is a fixed amount of oil in the ground, and once it is gone, we are done. It would be nice to believe renewables will take oil&rsquo;s place, but wind has never been very good at pushing cars the direction we want.</p>

<p>People have faith that batteries will come to our rescue, forgetting the immense number needed would consume more lithium or lead than is available. Until we think of some brilliant alternative, our way of life depends on oil. Not that our way of life is necessarily a good one, but we haven&rsquo;t planned out realistic alternatives. And oil isn&rsquo;t getting any easier to get our hands on.</p>

<p>Actually, it is worse than that. Oil lurks in &lsquo;traps&rsquo; unless it is heavy oil lying near the surface waiting to leach into the environment. The remaining oil not in the middle east is either out at sea, otherwise hard to get at, or tight oil, the stuff that has to be fracked. This stuff is stuck in stone&mdash;usually shale&mdash;that is barely porous and hard to get it out of. That is why drillers have to shatter the trap under extraordinary pressure, then jam proppants into the cracks to keep them open.</p>

<p>Fracking is weird stuff, using millions of gallons of water along with mystery ingredients that dissolve difficult rocks or prevent stubborn bacteria or chemical deposits gumming things up. Weirdly enough, they also use guar gum as a gelling agent to hold proppant in solution (you many know it as an indigestible food additive.) The most fascinating items are radioactive tracer isotopes used to determine the location of fractures.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>People panic when they discover fracking in their area&mdash;but as usual most miss the real problem. After all that liquid is injected, the drillers have to get as much as they can back out again before they can get at the oil. At this point the driller has maybe &frac34; of a million gallons of extremely polluted water to dispose of.</p>

<p>Because of this, it isn&rsquo;t drilling that causes problems. It is drillers disposing of toxic waste water into streams or shallow wells that then leach into drinking water. Even when they act sensibly and use dedicated deep wells they can inadvertently lubricate seismic faults and induce small earthquakes. Is it any wonder that citizens are starting to get concerned about having frackers in their neighbourhood?</p>

<p>Fracked wells are also costly. A single well can cost $8 million dollars. The end result (hopefully, given that geologists sometimes guess wrong&hellip;.) is a well that puts out a tremendous amount of oil. At first, anyway. Remember, this is tight oil. The stuff begins to ooze out of fractured rock, but not all the rock is fractured. The fractures may be propped open by sand, but whatever they inject, over a few months the mother rock settles around the proppant.</p>

<p>Within a year, maybe half of the oil that is going to ooze has made its way to the surface. Each month the well produces fewer and fewer barrels a day&mdash;in the couple of years it takes to get to a trickle &frac34; of the oil may still be locked in the rock. You can throw more and more money at the well to get what remains out faster, but the return on that investment grows less and less. With $40 oil, the well is more likely to be abandoned than stimulated.</p>

<p>This is the source of America&rsquo;s vaunted oil independence. First, its a kind of driller&rsquo;s Ponzi game, where more and more wells have to be drilled just to maintain production, yet the quality of the targets grows less and less. It should be an obvious problem, as no one intentionally drills the least likely site first.</p>

<p>Another challenge is that, oddly enough, fracking is the province of smaller drillers. Big oil was late to the party. Some of these guys were prudent with their money. Most weren&rsquo;t. The problem is that small drillers hoping to grow took out loans they could barely repay at the old prices. They bet the company on the price of oil staying up, then failed to cover their costs by selling next year&rsquo;s oil today. At current prices, many will be broke within a year. Believe me, I&rsquo;m not happy.</p>

<p>Finally, even with drills running day and night, Americans conveniently forget they import 40% of the oil they use. If the price of oil stays down, American oil production could decline by half within two years. That means America will be importing 70% of its oil while saving a ton of money at the pumps. The price for that oil will be little more than the cost of the oil imported last year. Saving money can&rsquo;t be all bad, so an investor should try to make money by figuring out long term winners and losers. Right?</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But this long run is a misleading guide&hellip;. In the long run we are all dead.&rdquo;<br>&mdash;Keynes</p></blockquote>

<p>That seems to capture the investors dilemma. We remember yesterday and imagine tomorrow, but anything beyond that is uncertain. Experienced investors accept they have no clear picture of the future. To balance this, they act as if today is all that matters. When times are good, animal spirits drive markets far beyond their real value. When everyone feels gloomy, prices fall swiftly to irrational lows. The challenge for an astute investor is determining just how irrationally high or low prices will go.</p>

<p>Following the economic meltdown of 2008, the oil price collapsed to around $30 a barrel. With six years of inflation and increased production costs, $40 is the most absurd low anyone can now consider. Can it happen? Logically, no. It would destroy too many companies in the oil industry, particularly over-leveraged American firms. Worse, it might take their investors and banks with them.</p>

<p>Yet fear of this possibility is growing. Already billions of dollars of projects have been put on hold. The confusing graph below shows that already, at today&rsquo;s price range, only 6 million barrels per day can be relied on to add to our available oil. Over 35 million barrels per day will be &lsquo;delayed&rsquo;. This is a bigger deal than it appears. Those new barrels would not come close to replacing output from wells that are slowly drying up.</p>

<p><img src="/on/images/2014-12-20_175323.jpg" title="oil prices needed for volumes of new oil" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>If prices do bottom out and hold, in five years even the Saudis (gasp!) would be having trouble keeping their volume up. They overstate their reserves, never deduct production, and will eventually discover physical reality can&rsquo;t be ignored forever.</p>

<p>Russia would have been forced into partnership with China to develop replacements for their older declining fields and that new oil would be contracted to China. America and Europe would be left out. This in itself would be dangerous. Japan entered the second world war because America locked them out of oil from Indonesia that Japan needed to grow their economy.</p>

<p>Within five years American tight oil would be declining to stripper mode, most wells only yielding a few barrels a day. In this scenario North Sea oil would be crippled, with many current wells abandoned with all traces removed&mdash;at great expense. No imaginable price would make reviving them possible. The Gulf of Mexico would be on its last legs and Alaska would not produce enough oil to run their pipeline. Canada&rsquo;s oil sands would be struggling to survive with many projects shut in.</p>

<p>This would be a triumph for environmentalists, would allow the Saudis to rejoice in crushing Iran, and would let the USA feel they had punished Russia. The real loser, of course, would be anyone wanting to preserve their standard of living. All those bankruptcies in the oil industry would have unfortunate knock-on effects, then as oil production declined, losses in production would force the price for what is left to abruptly rise to ridiculous heights. This would temporarily crush the world economy, causing oil prices to fall again, and no one is willing to speculate on what would happen next. The only thing clear is that few producers of real goods thrive amid chaos. Non-productive hedge funds might get rich&mdash;but it can be hard to eat or keep warm with paper profits alone.</p>

<p>The risk is that now the decline in prices has started, external causes will ensure it continues down to $40 a barrel or lower. The end effect of whiplashing prices would thrust us willy-nilly into a post oil economy. Know any farmers with enough horses to plow their fields or cart their crops to market? You could expect a few hungry days to follow.</p>

<p>If this price drop defies logic and continues, the main cause will be the extraordinary levels of debt dragging down every economy. Addiction to so-called Keynesian economics (more honestly known as buying votes) has led most countries in the world to spend their way out of recession. They used national assets so recklessly that they swallowed up the money needed to support small businesses, the real engines of growth. When the next recession takes hold, most countries will find themselves in a hole without the resources to dig themselves out.</p>

<p>Recklessly amassing debt was known to be stupid in the past. Unfortunately a new dogma arose among the political elite, one claiming the government needs to spend the economy out of downturns. Done with discipline, this might actually work. Unfortunately governments can&rsquo;t help throwing away money on wasteful vote winning programs while feeling no need to pare expenses once an emergency ends.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is an extraordinary example of how, starting with a mistake, a remorseless logician can end up in bedlam.<br>&mdash;Keynes</p></blockquote>

<p>One odd thing is that no one can say exactly how and why the oil price decline started. Circumstantial evidence suggests the American government colluded with the Saudi government to trigger the first fire sale, knowing the market would turn it into a rout. With ISIS selling stolen oil to finance their activity, cutting the price they get must seem desirable. However, no authority is publicly admitting this goal, perhaps fearing they would then become a target for revenge.</p>

<p>The Saudis publicly limit themselves to saying they are doing it to limit competition from American tight oil. They and the USA want us to believe the world is awash in this mite of <em>new</em> oil (less than 3% of world production), and this is a natural market response. Given that expected increases in world demand are close to the increase in American production, that logic seems weak. The rigidity of the market, with no easy way for consumers to change consumption in response to price changes, does support this idea&mdash;yet the world does not seem to really be awash in extra oil.</p>

<p>Others point out that futures markets drive oil prices. Futures involve almost ten times the actual volume of oil used every day as contracts for delayed delivery. These largely imaginary deals are supposed to help reveal what the future price of oil will be, and thus preserve capital in the markets. What they do instead is give the trading desks of banks an opportunity to profit from inside information, for hedge funds to put billions into artificially moving markets, and for the little guys, yet another place to gamble on what the market &lsquo;should&rsquo; do, and so lose money.</p>

<p>Still others point out that the decline in oil prices may be linked to a simultaneous increase in the value of the American dollar, so that at first there wasn&rsquo;t any real loss of value. In this case, the eventual rout echoes the Vedic tale of the snake in the string:</p>

<p>&ldquo;While walking at night, in the dim light a shape was seen on the ground. It looked like a snake, snakes can be poisonous. Everyone ran in terror, injuring themselves as they fled. There never was a snake, yet fear of an imaginary one turned out just as dangerous as the reality would have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This tale is told to remind us that our experiences aren&rsquo;t some eternal truth, but strongly effected by mis-perceptions. To avoid panic, it is necessary to root life in more fundamental levels of reality.</p>

<p>After carefully considering things, the only conclusion I can come to (except that I&rsquo;ve managed to destroy my assets) is that once again, Keynes was right:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is generally agreed that casinos should, in the public interest, be inaccessible and expensive. And perhaps the same is true of Stock Exchanges.</p></blockquote>

<p>But there is an opportunity hidden in this mess. I could start a spa treating troubled shareholders. Just think how much money I could make from investors panicked by unprecedented price volatility!</p>
