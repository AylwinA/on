<p>America has a long celebrated righteous rebellion. When unfair laws were enforced on behalf of a distant and unrepresentative Parliament, American threw off the yoke of tyranny. The leaders of that effort continue to be f&ecirc;ted for their bravery and nobility of purpose. With that tradition, shouldn&rsquo;t we expect protests to break out, given folks in D.C. have proven to be distant and unrepresentative? In the same way, why are we surprised when parts of a community celebrate a descent into lawlessness?</p>

<p>The founding fathers were outraged by repressive governance. The revolution resulted in a system of political checks and balances and unique democratization of the legal process. The unexpected end result was a century of blatant corruption. That too has (mostly) worked out, but politicians still remain open to vote buying expedients. They also have a curious relationship to the law. Successful candidates often have a legal education. Some drove their career forward with publicity from high profile trials at the DA&rsquo;s office. All of this makes politicians part of the problem, not part of the solution.</p>

<p>Lawyer driven administrations continue to accumulate of regulations and laws. America already has more lawyers per capita than any other country. They are also better paid, swallowing a greater percentage of GDP. As the burden of regulation spirals out of control, it should be obvious that something fundamental is wrong. As the Roman historian Tacitus said: &ldquo;<strong>The more corrupt the state, the more numerous the laws.</strong>&rdquo;</p>

<p>One area where corruption has become rampant is recreational drugs. Yes, they are bad. So is liquor, yet after banning it proved fruitless, we found a better way of dealing with it. We haven&rsquo;t yet become adult enough to deal with this issue.</p>

<p>The problem is that each party has a cadre of dedicated helpers drawn from small but active communities. In order to ensure their help, favours are given. An attempt, many years ago, to appeal to the puritanically virtuous elements in party supporters resulted in a war on drugs. To give up that fight risks giving up that support. The party that blinks first loses most.</p>

<p>Because of that misguided plan, prison rates in the US have become the world&rsquo;s highest. Today three quarters of one percent of the <em>whole</em> population is incarcerated. When you only include adults, the figure grows to significantly over 1%. A less gifted 1%, one that no one wants to talk about.</p>

<p>When you only include black adults, the statistics become staggering. Nearly one in three black males between 20&ndash;29 are under some form of criminal justice supervision; either imprisoned, jailed, on parole or probation. The United States has less than 5% of the world&rsquo;s population yet it is burdened with a quarter of the world&rsquo;s prison population.</p>

<p>The average American lives a life of ease unimaginable by the revolutionaries. The average citizen no longer must tend small fields for long hours to earn subsistence and little more. Instead, the modern American endures a boring job, believes it doesn&rsquo;t pay enough, and trusts in a natural a right to justice along with untrammelled enjoyment of the world&rsquo;s highest standard of living.</p>

<p>Our forefathers worried about survival. We worry that wages are stagnant while those who run the country promote inflation. Erosion of the ability of the average American to earn, spend, and enjoy is for most of us, a crisis. The unequal distribution of punishment by the law is a story we have heard of, but don&rsquo;t really believe is happening.</p>

<p>The origin of much of this &lsquo;criminality&rsquo; is in mistaken laws. Some laws pay the poor to remain poor. The worst criminalize the only activities some of these social outcasts have skills for. This has created a culture that knows &lsquo;the man&rsquo; is against them and celebrates every petty opportunity to hit back</p>

<p>The makers of those laws have been allowed to arrogantly continue on the same doomed course, doubling up on laws, on policing, adding military gear to use against their own people. They fail to understand that laws have to be reasonable to be effective.</p>

<p>The lawyering up of modern society has transformed our economy into one based on rights holdings. America&rsquo;s great companies no longer make physical products. Instead of railroads and heavy industry, Banks and Google are the most profitable per employee. Google&rsquo;s geeks lucked into virtual control of internet advertising and at least try to follow their motto &ldquo;<em>Don&rsquo;t be evil</em>.&rdquo;
Apple, the stock market&rsquo;s richest company, is in many ways startlingly similar to Google and Goldman Sachs.</p>

<p>Apple has a design portfolio that allows it to do little more than litigate while marketing products designed and made by captive foreign manufacturers. This shift from making things to rent collection been based almost entirely on international laws, like those governing Intellectual Property rights.</p>
