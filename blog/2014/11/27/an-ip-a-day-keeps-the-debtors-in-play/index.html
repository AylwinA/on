<p>The problems in Ferguson have their roots in one simple perception: The law is unequal and dangerous. It clearly treats the wealthy and whites better than others. Even among those who are supposedly favoured by the system, the costs of due process destroy wealth and consume lives. Law has degenerated into a tool of oppression. Misrule of law doesn&rsquo;t just grind down people. Bad laws and indifferent lawyers are ruining an entire country.</p>

<blockquote><p>All around the world, lawyers generate more hostility than the members of any other profession&hellip;. But there are few places where clients have more grounds for complaint than America.
<em>&mdash;The Economist</em></p></blockquote>

<p>One American in 265 works as a lawyer. Doesn&rsquo;t sound so bad, until you realize &frac14; of the population is under twenty (know any kids practising law?) and 1/3 of those working age don&rsquo;t actually work. Heck, when we take out the underemployed and the aged, it becomes even worse. Lets just say that around one percent of the fully employed are lawyers. Now where have we seen that figure before&hellip;.</p>

<p>The lawyering up of modern America has been a significant part of the transformation of our economy into one based on renting out rights. Great companies no longer manufacture great products. Instead of relying on heavy industry, technology rents are producing all the wealth. If that doesn&rsquo;t make sense, think about the Microsoft software you use every day, but can no longer own.</p>

<p>Many American oil companies are also raking in the bucks. Their money comes from high tech as
well. Fracking for shale oil is impossible without 3D seismic, directional drilling, and a whole host of other technologies only geeks can understand. Those companies thrived
under high oil prices and may collapse on low. For now, like Jed Clampett, they produce liquid
gold, &lsquo;renting&rsquo; technology and mineral rights (making their owners rich) while needing hardly any staff.</p>

<p>Apple lucked into patentable control of digital music, and from there stumbled into phones. Its intellectual property portfolio allows it to do little more than litigate away competition while selling at great profit products designed and made by captive foreign manufacturers. This kind of market control easily leads to complacency. Since this has long been one of Apples problems, expect things there to start going downhill. Maybe not this year, but given a few years their role in phones may look a lot like Blackberry.</p>

<p>This shift from making things to rent collection is based almost entirely on laws governing Intellectual Property rights. These laws have been crammed down the throats of every country wishing to trade with the good old USA. It is amusing to look back at the past behaviour of great American companies. The founder of Hershey chocolates proudly proclaimed that he had stolen the secrets of fine chocolates from the Swiss, using this claim to promote his brand. IP exists because it benefits America&rsquo;s leading companies. It isn&rsquo;t clear that it benefits the average person, and especially it doesn&rsquo;t help the developing world</p>

<p>All this modern legal stuff letting high tech companies earn high rewards also leads to one obvious problem. There are mostly lawyers, techies and salespeople on the inside. Some of those salespeople, like the bankers, are so good we&rsquo;re convinced they are experts who&rsquo;s financial advice clients can trust. Right.</p>

<p>The same bright lawyers in America&rsquo;s administration have undone structures established over generations to stabilize prices. With the help of brilliant programmers, hedge funds have exploited those markets, making billions by orchestrating, anticipating and encouraging price swings. These price swings make business riskier, but they also make bankers rich.</p>

<p>This leaves us in a position were ordinary jobs are increasingly insecure because of growing swings in commodity prices. Wealth is accumulating around those who take great risks that increase volatility and get rich from it, yet have a government safety net as they are &ldquo;too big to fail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With no one left producing real goods, those not in the system end up in the service economy. Service jobs, like flipping burgers or washing windows, don&rsquo;t pay well. They also destroy self esteem.</p>

<p>Ferguson ran aground over years of grievances about racial problems with policing. It is the tip of the iceberg of a far larger problem. With the average Joe unable to get into companies that control the high tech economy, many are slowly accepting they are losers. Holding no stakes in anyone else&rsquo;s success, unsure where they will be in a few years, given a chance some will act out their frustration. Don&rsquo;t be surprised when even more people turn up when some event triggers an equal-opportunity excuse to light bonfires in the streets.</p>
